\chapter{Trace Formulas in Lithomathematics}
\label{ch:trace-formulas}

\section*{Orientation and Scope}

The present chapter is devoted to the derivation, analysis, and refinement of
trace formulas for differential operators acting on domains with fracture
structures. In classical spectral theory, trace formulas connect geometric
invariants of a domain with spectral invariants of associated operators,
providing deep insights into the interplay between geometry and analysis. 
In lithomathematics, the situation is enriched by the presence of
fracture sets, denoted $\Gamma$, which introduce singular contributions and
require a careful microlocal treatment.

The classical lineage of trace formulas dates back to the pioneering work of
Hermann Weyl, who established the asymptotic distribution of eigenvalues for
the Laplacian on smooth bounded domains, and was further developed by Levitan,
Hörmander, Ivrii, and Safarov–Vassiliev, among others. In the smooth setting,
trace formulas take the form of expansions involving volume, boundary, and
curvature terms. In fractured domains, however, additional contributions arise,
which we refer to as \emph{fracture coefficients}. The primary objective of
this chapter is to establish a mathematically rigorous framework in which such
coefficients can be defined, computed, and controlled.

\subsection*{Goals}

The goals of this chapter are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{G\arabic*}]
  \item \textbf{G1:} To formulate a general trace expansion for operators of the form
  \[
    \mathcal{A} = -\Delta_g + V
  \]
  acting on $H^1_0(\Omega \setminus \Gamma)$, where $(\Omega,g)$ is a compact
  Riemannian manifold with Lipschitz boundary and $\Gamma \subset \Omega$ is a
  $(d-1)$-rectifiable fracture set.
  \item \textbf{G2:} To isolate and characterize the \emph{fracture
  contribution coefficients} $a_\Gamma$, arising naturally from microlocal
  analysis near $\Gamma$.
  \item \textbf{G3:} To establish quantitative remainder estimates of the form
  \[
    \mathcal{R}(\lambda,\eta;T_0) = O(\lambda^{-\delta}),
  \]
  with $\delta > 0$ depending explicitly on geometric and spectral parameters.
  \item \textbf{G4:} To develop canonical models in which the fracture
  contribution can be explicitly computed, thereby calibrating the theory
  against tractable examples.
  \item \textbf{G5:} To integrate these results into the variational–spectral
  framework of lithomathematics, ensuring compatibility with the definition of
  the litho-ratio $K_L$ and its ergodic properties.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Invariants}

The following invariants will serve as guiding principles throughout the
chapter:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{I\arabic*}]
  \item \textbf{I1:} Self-adjointness of the operator $\mathcal{A}$ with
  explicitly defined domain.
  \item \textbf{I2:} Explicit dependence of all constants on geometric data
  $(\Omega,g,\Gamma)$ and analytic data $V$.
  \item \textbf{I3:} All remainder terms are given with quantitative exponents
  $\delta$, not vague asymptotics.
  \item \textbf{I4:} Fracture contributions appear linearly in $\mathcal{H}^{d-1}(\Gamma)$,
  with correction terms justified microlocally.
  \item \textbf{I5:} Compatibility with homogenization and ergodic averaging
  results of Chapter~\ref{ch:homogenization}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Hypotheses}

The principal hypotheses underpinning the derivations are:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{H\arabic*}]
  \item \textbf{H1 (Geometric Regularity):} $\Omega$ is a compact $C^{2,\alpha}$
  Riemannian manifold with Lipschitz boundary.
  \item \textbf{H2 (Fracture Rectifiability):} $\Gamma \subset \Omega$ is a
  compact $(d-1)$-rectifiable set with uniformly bounded
  $\mathcal{H}^{d-1}$-measure.
  \item \textbf{H3 (Potential Regularity):} $V \in L^\infty(\Omega)$.
  \item \textbf{H4 (Spectral Gap Condition):} The semigroup generated by
  $\mathcal{A}$ satisfies exponential mixing with rate $\lambda > 0$.
  \item \textbf{H5 (Paley–Wiener Localization):} Test functions $g \in
  C_c^\infty(\mathbb{R})$ have compact Fourier support $\mathrm{supp}(\hat g)
  \subset [-T_0,T_0]$ with $T_0$ finite.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Positioning in the Literature}

This chapter builds upon and extends classical trace formulas. In particular:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Weyl (1911)}: Eigenvalue asymptotics on smooth domains.
  \item \textbf{Ivrii (1980s)}: Boundary contributions under geometric
  assumptions.
  \item \textbf{Safarov–Vassiliev (1997)}: Comprehensive microlocal treatment
  of spectral asymptotics.
  \item \textbf{Bourdin–Francfort–Marigo (2008)}: Variational models of
  fracture via $\Gamma$-convergence.
  \item \textbf{Giusti–Mazzola (2020)}: Spectral asymptotics on singular sets.
\end{itemize}

Our novelty lies in systematically combining microlocal parametrix
construction with variational principles in fractured domains, thereby
introducing fracture coefficients $a_\Gamma$ as rigorous spectral invariants.

\subsection*{Conclusion of Orientation}

This orientation establishes the need for a fully rigorous extension of trace
formulas to fractured domains, formulates precise goals (G1–G5), defines
invariants (I1–I5), and enumerates hypotheses (H1–H5). The subsequent sections
will develop the microlocal tools required to prove the main trace expansion,
followed by explicit remainder estimates, canonical examples, and an integrated
audit in accordance with the Diamond Standard v3.0.

\section{Definitions and Notational Framework}
\label{sec:trace-definitions}

This section introduces the core definitions and notation used throughout
the chapter. Since the derivation of trace formulas in fractured domains
requires a delicate balance of geometric measure theory, microlocal analysis,
and variational methods, we adopt a unified system of definitions that remain
consistent across the monograph. All objects are stated with explicit domains,
spaces, and regularity assumptions to preserve the Diamond Standard v3.0
requirements of reproducibility and clarity.

\subsection{Fractured Domains and Function Spaces}

\begin{definition}[Fractured Domain]
Let $(\Omega,g)$ be a compact $d$-dimensional Riemannian manifold with Lipschitz boundary $\partial \Omega$. A \emph{fractured domain} is a pair
\[
(\Omega, \Gamma),
\]
where $\Gamma \subset \Omega$ is a compact, $(d-1)$-rectifiable set (the fracture set), endowed with its $(d-1)$-dimensional Hausdorff measure $\mathcal{H}^{d-1}$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Admissible Function Space]
On a fractured domain $(\Omega,\Gamma)$ we define
\[
H^1_0(\Omega \setminus \Gamma) = \{ u \in H^1(\Omega \setminus \Gamma): u|_{\partial\Omega} = 0\}.
\]
This space encodes both Dirichlet boundary conditions on $\partial\Omega$ and implicit jump discontinuities across $\Gamma$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
The use of $H^1_0(\Omega \setminus \Gamma)$ rather than $H^1_0(\Omega)$ is essential: functions are permitted to have discontinuities along $\Gamma$, but are globally controlled by Sobolev embedding theorems. This framework aligns with the variational theory of brittle fracture \cite{BourdinFrancfortMarigo2008}.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Operators and Quadratic Forms}

\begin{definition}[Fractured Schrödinger Operator]
Let $V \in L^\infty(\Omega)$ be a real-valued potential. The fractured Schrödinger operator is defined as
\[
\mathcal{A} = -\Delta_g + V,
\]
acting on the domain
\[
\mathrm{Dom}(\mathcal{A}) = \{ u \in H^1_0(\Omega \setminus \Gamma): \Delta_g u \in L^2(\Omega\setminus\Gamma)\}.
\]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Quadratic Form]
The quadratic form associated with $\mathcal{A}$ is
\[
\mathcal{Q}[u] = \int_{\Omega \setminus \Gamma} \left( |\nabla_g u|^2 + V |u|^2 \right) \, d\mu_g,
\]
where $d\mu_g$ is the Riemannian volume measure. 
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[Self-Adjointness]
Under assumptions H1–H3, the operator $\mathcal{A}$ is self-adjoint on $L^2(\Omega \setminus \Gamma)$ with domain defined above.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}[Sketch of Proof]
The quadratic form $\mathcal{Q}$ is densely defined, closed, and bounded below.
By the representation theorem of Friedrichs, $\mathcal{A}$ is self-adjoint. 
The fracture set $\Gamma$ is compact and $(d-1)$-rectifiable, hence of capacity zero with respect to $H^1$, so no essential spectrum arises solely from $\Gamma$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Spectral Functions and Traces}

\begin{definition}[Spectral Measure and Density of States]
Let $\{ \lambda_j \}_{j=1}^\infty$ denote the eigenvalues of $\mathcal{A}$, listed with multiplicities.
The spectral measure is
\[
dN(\lambda) = \sum_{j} \delta(\lambda - \lambda_j).
\]
The density of states is its distributional derivative:
\[
\rho(\lambda) = \frac{d}{d\lambda} N(\lambda).
\]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Spectral Trace]
For $g \in C_c^\infty(\mathbb{R})$, the spectral trace is defined by
\[
\mathrm{Tr}(g(\sqrt{\mathcal{A}})) = \sum_{j} g(\sqrt{\lambda_j}).
\]
\end{definition}

This definition generalizes the notion of traces of functions of operators, 
and is well-defined by functional calculus for self-adjoint operators. 

\subsection{Fracture Contribution Coefficients}

\begin{definition}[Fracture Contribution Coefficient]
Let $g \in C_c^\infty(\mathbb{R})$ be even, with $\mathrm{supp}(\hat g) \subset [-T_0, T_0]$. 
The fracture contribution coefficient $a_\Gamma(g)$ is the additional term in the trace formula arising from $\Gamma$:
\[
a_\Gamma(g) \, \mathcal{H}^{d-1}(\Gamma).
\]
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
This definition formalizes the intuition that each fracture behaves like an “internal boundary,” contributing additively to the spectral trace. Quantitative expressions for $a_\Gamma(g)$ will be derived in later sections via microlocal parametrices.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Litho-Ratio Revisited}

\begin{definition}[Litho-Ratio $K_L$]
Given ordering power $\mathcal{P}_{\mathrm{ord}}(t)$ and fracture power $\mathcal{P}_{\mathrm{br}}(t)$ as defined in Chapter~\ref{ch:invariant-ratio}, the litho-ratio is
\[
K_L(T) = \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T \frac{\mathcal{P}_{\mathrm{ord}}(t)}{\mathcal{P}_{\mathrm{br}}(t)} dt.
\]
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
The connection between trace formulas and $K_L$ is subtle but fundamental: spectral expansions inform the time-averaged ratio via ergodic theorems, while fracture coefficients directly enter $\mathcal{P}_{\mathrm{br}}(t)$ through dissipation rates.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Notation Summary}

For the reader’s convenience, the main symbols introduced here are summarized:

\begin{itemize}
  \item $\Omega$: compact $d$-dimensional Riemannian manifold with Lipschitz boundary.
  \item $\Gamma$: compact $(d-1)$-rectifiable fracture set.
  \item $\mathcal{A}$: fractured Schrödinger operator $-\Delta_g + V$.
  \item $\mathcal{Q}$: associated quadratic form.
  \item $\{ \lambda_j \}$: eigenvalues of $\mathcal{A}$.
  \item $N(\lambda), \rho(\lambda)$: counting function and density of states.
  \item $\mathrm{Tr}(g(\sqrt{\mathcal{A}}))$: spectral trace.
  \item $a_\Gamma$: fracture contribution coefficient.
  \item $K_L$: litho-ratio.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Closure of Definitions Block}

This section fixed the vocabulary and analytic framework necessary to rigorously derive trace formulas in fractured domains. By explicitly stating the geometry, operator, spectral structures, and fracture coefficients, we ensure that subsequent theorems are built upon a transparent foundation. The next section develops the microlocal parametrix construction required to isolate and compute the fracture contribution in trace expansions.

\section{Microlocal Parametrix Construction}
\label{sec:parametrix}

The central analytic tool in the derivation of localized trace formulas
is the microlocal parametrix for the wave propagator associated with the
fractured Schrödinger operator $\mathcal{A}$. This section presents the
construction in rigorous detail, emphasizing the adjustments required by
the presence of the fracture set $\Gamma$. 

\subsection{Wave Kernel on Smooth Domains}

We begin by recalling the standard construction of the wave kernel on smooth
compact Riemannian manifolds $(\Omega,g)$ without fractures.

\begin{definition}[Wave Kernel]
Let $\mathcal{A} = -\Delta_g + V$ with $V \in L^\infty(\Omega)$.
The wave kernel is
\[
K(t,x,y) = \cos\!\big( t \sqrt{\mathcal{A}} \big)(x,y),
\]
the Schwartz kernel of the operator $\cos(t\sqrt{\mathcal{A}})$.
\end{definition}

By functional calculus, $K(t,x,y)$ admits an oscillatory integral
representation for $|t|$ small:
\[
K(t,x,y) \sim (2\pi)^{-d} \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} 
e^{i \langle \xi, \exp_x^{-1}(y)\rangle} 
a(t,x,y,\xi)\, d\xi,
\]
where $a$ is a classical symbol with expansion
\[
a(t,x,y,\xi) \sim \sum_{j=0}^\infty a_j(t,x,y,\xi).
\]

\subsection{Parametrix in the Presence of Fractures}

When $\Gamma \subset \Omega$ is present, functions in the domain of
$\mathcal{A}$ may have jump discontinuities across $\Gamma$. Consequently,
the wave kernel acquires additional singularities localized near $\Gamma$.

\begin{proposition}[Structure of the Fractured Parametrix]
\label{prop:fractured-parametrix}
There exists a microlocal decomposition
\[
K(t,x,y) = K_{\mathrm{bulk}}(t,x,y) + K_{\mathrm{fract}}(t,x,y),
\]
where:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
  \item $K_{\mathrm{bulk}}$ has the same oscillatory integral representation as
  the smooth-domain kernel, valid away from $\Gamma$.
  \item $K_{\mathrm{fract}}$ is supported in a conic neighborhood of
  the cotangent bundle over $\Gamma$, and admits an oscillatory representation
  with amplitude depending on the jump geometry of $\Gamma$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}[Sketch of Proof]
The construction follows the microlocal parametrix of Hörmander
\cite{Hormander1994} with adaptation to boundary and interface problems
\cite{Melrose1993}. Locally, near $p \in \Gamma$, the domain is modeled
on a hyperplane fracture in $\mathbb{R}^d$. The reflection-transmission
method yields a decomposition of the propagator into a transmitted wave
and a reflected wave, each with symbol expansions determined by the jump
conditions. A partition of unity reduces the global construction to the
local model. 
\end{proof}

\subsection{Local Model: Half-Space with Interface}

To fix ideas, let us consider $\Omega = \mathbb{R}^d$ and $\Gamma = \{x_d=0\}$.
In this case, solutions to the wave equation
\[
(\partial_t^2 + \mathcal{A}) u = 0, \quad u|_{t=0}=f, \ \partial_t u|_{t=0}=g
\]
are expressed as superpositions of plane waves. The interface at $x_d=0$
imposes jump conditions, which in the simplest case are Dirichlet on both
sides. Then
\[
K_{\mathrm{fract}}(t,x,y) \sim (2\pi)^{-d} 
\int_{\mathbb{R}^{d-1}} e^{i \langle \eta, x'-y'\rangle}
b(t,x_d,y_d,\eta) \, d\eta,
\]
with $b$ a symbol depending on $x_d,y_d$ and vanishing when $x_d,y_d$
are on the same side of $\Gamma$.

\begin{remark}
This local model highlights that fracture contributions arise from
wave interactions with $\Gamma$. In geometric terms, $\Gamma$ acts
like a semi-transparent boundary.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Stationary Phase and Fracture Coefficients}

Applying the stationary phase method to $K_{\mathrm{fract}}(t,x,y)$
leads to coefficients $a_\Gamma(g)$ in the spectral trace. Specifically,
the Fourier transform in $t$ of the wave kernel produces terms of the form
\[
\widehat{K}_{\mathrm{fract}}(\lambda,x,x) \sim 
a_\Gamma(\lambda)\, \delta_\Gamma(x),
\]
where $\delta_\Gamma$ is the measure supported on $\Gamma$.

\begin{theorem}[Fracture Coefficient via Stationary Phase]
\label{thm:fracture-coefficient}
Let $g \in C_c^\infty(\mathbb{R})$ be even with $\mathrm{supp}(\hat g) \subset [-T_0,T_0]$.
Then the fracture contribution coefficient in the trace expansion is
\[
a_\Gamma(g) = (2\pi)^{-(d-1)} \int_{\mathbb{R}^{d-1}} g(|\eta|) \, d\eta,
\]
up to error $O(T_0^{d-2})$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Sketch of Proof]
Apply Fourier inversion:
\[
\mathrm{Tr}(g(\sqrt{\mathcal{A}})) = \int_{\mathbb{R}} \hat g(t)\,
\mathrm{Tr}(\cos(t\sqrt{\mathcal{A}}))\, dt.
\]
Decompose $\cos(t\sqrt{\mathcal{A}})$ into bulk and fractured parts.
On the fractured part, restrict integration to neighborhoods of $\Gamma$.
Use stationary phase in $(d-1)$ variables tangent to $\Gamma$. The leading
term is precisely the stated integral.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Comparison with Boundary Terms}

\begin{remark}[Fracture vs. Boundary Contributions]
The coefficient $a_\Gamma(g)$ mirrors the boundary contribution $a_{\partial \Omega}(g)$
that arises in the standard heat or wave trace expansion on manifolds with boundary
\cite{Seeley1967, Ivrii1980}. The novelty here is that $\Gamma$ is an internal
singularity rather than an external boundary, yet it contributes additively to the
trace with the same symbolic structure.
\end{remark}

\subsection*{Closure of Parametrix Section}

This section established the microlocal parametrix construction for the fractured
wave kernel, culminating in Theorem~\ref{thm:fracture-coefficient}. The fracture
contribution coefficients $a_\Gamma(g)$ emerge naturally via stationary phase
arguments and provide the bridge between microlocal analysis and the variational
definition of the litho-ratio. The next section derives the full trace expansion,
combining bulk, boundary, and fracture terms.

\section{Full Trace Expansion on Fractured Domains}
\label{sec:full-trace}

Having established the microlocal parametrix in Section~\ref{sec:parametrix},
we now proceed to derive the full localized trace expansion. The purpose of
this section is to synthesize the bulk, boundary, and fracture contributions
into a single global formula, and to quantify the remainder with explicit
decay rates.

\subsection{Spectral Projector Framework}

Let $E(\lambda) = \mathbf{1}_{[0,\lambda]}(\sqrt{\mathcal{A}})$ denote the
spectral projector of $\mathcal{A}$. For a test function $g \in C_c^\infty(\mathbb{R})$,
the localized spectral trace is
\[
\mathrm{Tr}\, g(\sqrt{\mathcal{A}}) = \int_{\mathbb{R}} \hat g(t)\,
\mathrm{Tr}(\cos(t\sqrt{\mathcal{A}}))\, dt.
\]
Decomposing $\cos(t\sqrt{\mathcal{A}})$ into its bulk, boundary, and fracture
parts, the expansion is expected to take the form:
\[
\mathrm{Tr}\, g(\sqrt{\mathcal{A}}) =
\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{bulk}}(g) +
\mathcal{T}_{\partial \Omega}(g) +
\mathcal{T}_\Gamma(g) + \mathcal{R}(g).
\]

\subsection{Bulk Contribution}

The bulk contribution coincides with the classical Weyl term.

\begin{theorem}[Bulk Contribution]
\label{thm:bulk-contribution}
For $g \in C_c^\infty(\mathbb{R})$, the bulk contribution is
\[
\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{bulk}}(g) =
(2\pi)^{-d} \int_\Omega \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} g(|\xi|)\, d\xi\, d\mathrm{vol}_g(x).
\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
This is the standard Fourier inversion argument applied to the symbol of
$\mathcal{A}$. See \cite{Hormander1994} for the classical parametrix and
\cite{Ivrii1980} for details of the trace expansion.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Boundary Contribution}

On manifolds with boundary, an additional term arises.

\begin{theorem}[Boundary Contribution]
\label{thm:boundary-contribution}
If $\partial \Omega \neq \emptyset$, then
\[
\mathcal{T}_{\partial \Omega}(g) =
(2\pi)^{-(d-1)} \int_{\partial \Omega} \int_{\mathbb{R}^{d-1}} g(|\eta|)\, d\eta\, d\mathcal{H}^{d-1}(s).
\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{remark}
This formula is consistent with the classical boundary correction in the
heat kernel expansion (see \cite{Seeley1967, Gilkey1995}).
\end{remark}

\subsection{Fracture Contribution}

We now add the contribution from the fracture set $\Gamma$.

\begin{theorem}[Fracture Contribution]
\label{thm:fracture-contribution}
Let $\Gamma \subset \Omega$ be a compact rectifiable set. Then
\[
\mathcal{T}_\Gamma(g) =
(2\pi)^{-(d-1)} \int_\Gamma \int_{\mathbb{R}^{d-1}} g(|\eta|)\, d\eta\, d\mathcal{H}^{d-1}(s).
\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Sketch of Proof]
Apply Proposition~\ref{prop:fractured-parametrix} and Theorem~\ref{thm:fracture-coefficient}.
The local model yields coefficients $a_\Gamma(g)$, which integrate over $\Gamma$
to produce the global contribution.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Full Expansion}

Combining the three contributions, we obtain the localized trace formula.

\begin{theorem}[Localized Trace Formula on Fractured Domains]
\label{thm:full-trace}
Let $\Omega$ be a compact Riemannian manifold with Lipschitz boundary,
and $\Gamma \subset \Omega$ a compact rectifiable set. Let
$\mathcal{A} = -\Delta_g + V$ with $V \in L^\infty(\Omega)$.
For $g \in C_c^\infty(\mathbb{R})$ even with $\mathrm{supp}(\hat g) \subset [-T_0,T_0]$,
\[
\mathrm{Tr}\, g(\sqrt{\mathcal{A}}) =
\frac{1}{(2\pi)^d} \int_\Omega \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} g(|\xi|)\, d\xi\, d\mathrm{vol}_g(x)
+ \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{d-1}} \int_{\partial \Omega \cup \Gamma} \int_{\mathbb{R}^{d-1}} g(|\eta|)\, d\eta\, d\mathcal{H}^{d-1}(s)
+ \mathcal{R}(g).
\]
The remainder satisfies
\[
|\mathcal{R}(g)| \leq C \|g\|_{C^{d+3}} \Big( T_0^{d-2} \log(1+T_0) + e^{-cT_0} \Big),
\]
for constants $C,c > 0$ depending only on $(\Omega,g,\|V\|_\infty)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{remark}[Novelty]
The key novelty lies in the term $\int_\Gamma$, which extends the
boundary correction to interior fracture sets. This places fractured
domains on equal footing with domains with boundary in trace formulas.
\end{remark}

\subsection*{Closure of Trace Expansion Section}

This section presented the complete localized trace expansion on fractured
domains, Theorem~\ref{thm:full-trace}. The next part addresses refinements:
power-saving improvements, uniformity in the spectral parameter, and
applications to the litho-ratio invariant.

\section{Power-Saving Refinements of the Localized Trace Formula}
\label{sec:power-saving}

\subsection{Motivation}

The localized trace formula derived in Theorem~\ref{thm:full-trace} already
provides a decomposition into bulk, boundary, and fracture contributions,
with a quantitative remainder estimate depending on the time cutoff $T_0$.
However, in many applications — particularly those involving spectral
statistics and the definition of invariants such as the litho-ratio — one
requires remainder estimates sharper than logarithmic order. Specifically,
it is essential to demonstrate \emph{power-saving decay} in terms of the
spectral parameter $\lambda$.

This section establishes such power-saving refinements, quantifies the
decay rates, and shows how the geometry of fractures $\Gamma$ influences
the exponent of decay.

\subsection{Statement of Power-Saving Theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Power-Saving Localized Trace Formula]
\label{thm:power-saving}
Let $\Omega$ be a compact $C^{2,\alpha}$ Riemannian manifold with Lipschitz
boundary, and $\Gamma \subset \Omega$ a compact rectifiable set.
Let $\mathcal{A} = -\Delta_g + V$, where $V \in L^\infty(\Omega)$.
Fix parameters $\lambda \gg 1$, $0 < \theta < \tfrac{1}{2}$, and take
$\eta = \lambda^{-\theta}$. Let $g_\eta \in C_c^\infty(\mathbb{R})$ be
an even cutoff with $\widehat{g_\eta}$ supported in $[-\eta^{-1}, \eta^{-1}]$.

Then the localized trace satisfies
\[
\mathrm{Tr}\, g_\eta(\sqrt{\mathcal{A}}) =
\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{bulk}}(g_\eta) +
\mathcal{T}_{\partial \Omega}(g_\eta) +
\mathcal{T}_\Gamma(g_\eta) +
\mathcal{R}(\lambda,\eta),
\]
with a power-saving bound
\[
|\mathcal{R}(\lambda,\eta)| \leq C \lambda^{-\delta},
\quad
\delta = \min\left(\tfrac{1}{2} - \theta,\; \tfrac{\beta}{4}\right),
\]
where $\beta > 0$ is the spectral gap parameter associated with
exponential mixing of the geodesic flow.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Discussion of Parameters}

\paragraph{The cutoff scale $\eta$.}
The parameter $\eta = \lambda^{-\theta}$ defines the spectral window
$[\lambda-\eta,\lambda+\eta]$. Smaller values of $\theta$ (i.e.\ larger
windows) yield stronger averaging, which in turn improves the decay exponent
$\delta$. However, $\theta$ cannot exceed $1/2$ due to limitations from the
uncertainty principle.

\paragraph{The spectral gap $\beta$.}
The parameter $\beta$ encodes mixing properties of the geodesic flow on
$(\Omega,g)$. For hyperbolic manifolds, one can take $\beta$ as the
Selberg spectral gap (see \cite{Sarnak1990, BourgainGamburd2007}).
For manifolds with fractures $\Gamma$, the presence of singularities
reduces the effective spectral gap, leading to a smaller $\delta$.

\paragraph{Trade-off.}
The formula for $\delta$ reflects a trade-off:
\begin{itemize}
  \item if $\theta$ is small (wide window), the limiting factor is
  $\tfrac{\beta}{4}$,
  \item if $\theta$ is large (narrow window), the limiting factor is
  $\tfrac{1}{2} - \theta$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sketch of Proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof sketch]
1. Begin with the microlocal parametrix near $\Gamma$ constructed in
Section~\ref{sec:parametrix}.  

2. Apply the Fourier inversion formula for the spectral projector with
window $\eta$:
\[
\mathrm{Tr}\, g_\eta(\sqrt{\mathcal{A}}) =
\int_{\mathbb{R}} \hat g_\eta(t)\,
\mathrm{Tr}(\cos(t\sqrt{\mathcal{A}}))\, dt.
\]

3. Exploit the compact support of $\widehat{g_\eta}$ in $[-\eta^{-1}, \eta^{-1}]$
to restrict the integration range for $t$.

4. Use exponential mixing of the geodesic flow to estimate oscillatory
integrals with decay $O(\lambda^{-\beta/4})$, adapting arguments of
\cite{Jakobson1999, Dyatlov2016} to fractured domains.

5. Combine with non-stationary phase estimates to obtain the
$O(\lambda^{-(1/2-\theta)})$ contribution.

6. Take the minimum of these two exponents to obtain the bound for $\delta$.
\end{proof}

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Closure of Power-Saving Section}

Theorem~\ref{thm:power-saving} upgrades the localized trace formula by
quantifying polynomial decay in the remainder. This refinement is essential
for connecting spectral geometry with dynamical invariants such as the
litho-ratio. The next section focuses on \emph{uniformity in the spectral
parameter}, ensuring stability of expansions across wide spectral ranges.

\section{Uniformity in the Spectral Parameter}
\label{sec:uniformity}

\subsection{Motivation}

The localized trace formula, together with the power-saving refinement
from Theorem~\ref{thm:power-saving}, provides strong control of the
spectral side for a fixed $\lambda$.  
However, in applications one often requires \emph{uniform estimates across
ranges of $\lambda$}. For example:

\begin{itemize}
  \item in the derivation of local Weyl laws, $\lambda$ is allowed to
  vary asymptotically to infinity;
  \item in the computation of spectral averages relevant for the
  litho-ratio, one integrates over wide spectral windows;
  \item in numerical verifications, stability of the estimates across
  different $\lambda$ is essential for convergence.
\end{itemize}

This section develops uniform bounds in $\lambda$, quantifying how the
constants in the localized trace formula depend on the spectral
parameter.

\subsection{Statement of the Uniformity Theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Uniform Localized Trace Formula]
\label{thm:uniform-trace}
Let $(\Omega,g,\Gamma)$ and $\mathcal{A}$ be as in
Theorem~\ref{thm:power-saving}.
There exist constants $C, \delta > 0$ depending only on
$(\Omega,g,\|V\|_{L^\infty}, \mathcal{H}^{d-1}(\Gamma))$ such that
for all $\lambda \geq \lambda_0 \gg 1$ and
$\eta = \lambda^{-\theta}$ with $0 < \theta < 1/2$:
\[
\mathrm{Tr}\, g_\eta(\sqrt{\mathcal{A}}) =
\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{bulk}}(g_\eta) +
\mathcal{T}_{\partial \Omega}(g_\eta) +
\mathcal{T}_\Gamma(g_\eta) +
O(\lambda^{-\delta}),
\]
where the implied constant in the $O(\lambda^{-\delta})$ term
is uniform across $\lambda \geq \lambda_0$.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Discussion}

\paragraph{Uniformity across $\lambda$.}
The central point is that the constants controlling the remainder do not
grow with $\lambda$, once $\lambda$ exceeds the fixed threshold $\lambda_0$.
This ensures that the asymptotics are stable not only pointwise but also
in integrated or averaged regimes.

\paragraph{Impact on spectral statistics.}
Uniformity guarantees that when one studies variances of spectral
observables, such as $\sum_{\lambda_j \leq \Lambda} f(\lambda_j)$,
the error terms remain polynomially bounded with an exponent $\delta$
independent of $\Lambda$.  
This is essential for deriving central limit theorems and variance
bounds in quantum chaos \cite{Hejhal1994, Lindenstrauss2006, Dyatlov2016}.

\paragraph{Geometric dependence.}
The constants $C$ and $\delta$ may depend on the geometry of $\Omega$,
the regularity of $g$, and the size of $\Gamma$, but they remain
uniform in $\lambda$.  
This separation between geometric dependence and spectral growth is the
hallmark of the result.

\subsection{Sketch of Proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof sketch]
1. Begin with the representation of the localized trace as a time integral:
\[
\mathrm{Tr}\, g_\eta(\sqrt{\mathcal{A}}) =
\int_{\mathbb{R}} \widehat{g_\eta}(t)\,
\mathrm{Tr}(\cos(t\sqrt{\mathcal{A}}))\, dt.
\]

2. Observe that the kernel $\widehat{g_\eta}(t)$ is supported in
$[-\eta^{-1},\eta^{-1}] \asymp [-\lambda^\theta,\lambda^\theta]$,
so the time cutoff grows slowly with $\lambda$.

3. Apply microlocal analysis near the diagonal and near $\Gamma$,
ensuring that the parametrix construction remains stable across $\lambda$.
This requires explicit estimates on the dependence of the symbols
on $\lambda$.

4. Combine the exponential mixing of the geodesic flow (for large times)
with stationary phase analysis (for small times). Both components
yield constants independent of $\lambda$, provided the cutoff
is chosen at scale $\lambda^\theta$.

5. Conclude that the remainder is bounded by $C\lambda^{-\delta}$ with
$C$ depending only on geometric data, not on $\lambda$ itself.
\end{proof}

\subsection*{Closure of Uniformity Section}

Theorem~\ref{thm:uniform-trace} shows that the localized trace formula
retains its power-saving error term uniformly across the spectral
parameter $\lambda$.  
This result is a cornerstone for the stability of litho-ratio
computations, ensuring that both theoretical and numerical analyses
rest on firm ground. The next sections refine these results by
exploring \emph{quantitative dependence on fracture geometry} and
\emph{extensions to non-compact settings}.

\section{Dependence on Fracture Geometry}
\label{sec:fracture-geometry}

\subsection{Motivation}

The presence of fractures $\Gamma \subset \Omega$ plays a central role
in the behavior of the spectral trace.  
While the uniformity in $\lambda$ established in
Section~\ref{sec:uniformity} guarantees stability across spectral
parameters, the dependence of error terms and leading asymptotics on the
geometry of $\Gamma$ remains subtle.

The geometry of fractures influences:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item the measure $\mathcal{H}^{d-1}(\Gamma)$ and thus the coefficient
  of the boundary term in the trace formula;
  \item the rectifiability and curvature properties of $\Gamma$, which
  enter microlocal parametrices near singularities;
  \item topological and connectivity aspects, such as whether $\Gamma$
  divides $\Omega$ into disjoint subdomains;
  \item stochastic fluctuations, when $\Gamma$ is sampled from a random
  ensemble, e.g. Poisson fracture fields.
\end{enumerate}

Understanding this dependence is crucial for the stability of the
litho-ratio $K_L$ across heterogeneous media.

\subsection{Quantitative Statement}

\begin{theorem}[Geometric Dependence of the Localized Trace]
\label{thm:fracture-geometry}
Let $\Gamma \subset \Omega$ be a rectifiable set of codimension one with
finite Hausdorff measure. Then the localized trace formula has the form
\[
\mathrm{Tr}\, g_\eta(\sqrt{\mathcal{A}}) =
\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{bulk}}(g_\eta) +
\mathcal{T}_{\partial \Omega}(g_\eta) +
c_\Gamma(g_\eta)\, \mathcal{H}^{d-1}(\Gamma) +
R_\Gamma(\lambda,\eta),
\]
where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $c_\Gamma(g_\eta)$ depends on the microlocal structure near $\Gamma$;
  \item the remainder $R_\Gamma(\lambda,\eta)$ satisfies
  \[
  |R_\Gamma(\lambda,\eta)| \leq
  C(\Omega,g,\|V\|_{L^\infty}, \kappa(\Gamma))\,
  \lambda^{-\delta},
  \]
  with $\kappa(\Gamma)$ a geometric complexity parameter;
  \item $\delta>0$ is uniform, independent of $\Gamma$.
\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Definition of Geometric Complexity}

\begin{definition}[Geometric Complexity Parameter]
For a fracture set $\Gamma$, define
\[
\kappa(\Gamma) := \sup_{x \in \Gamma} (1+|A(x)| + \mathrm{mult}(x)),
\]
where $A(x)$ is the second fundamental form (when defined) and
$\mathrm{mult}(x)$ is the local multiplicity (number of intersecting
fracture sheets through $x$).  
Then $\kappa(\Gamma)$ provides a quantitative measure of how irregular
$\Gamma$ is.
\end{definition}

This parameter enters the constants in Theorem~\ref{thm:fracture-geometry},
ensuring that smoother and simpler $\Gamma$ yield smaller constants.

\subsection{Examples}

\paragraph{Example 1: Planar fracture.}
If $\Gamma$ is a flat hyperplane intersecting $\Omega$, then
$\kappa(\Gamma)=1$ and the constant $C$ is minimal.
The trace formula reduces to a volume–boundary decomposition with a
sharp fracture term.

\paragraph{Example 2: Curved fracture.}
For $\Gamma$ with bounded curvature, $\kappa(\Gamma)\asymp 1+\sup|A(x)|$,
and constants grow linearly with curvature.

\paragraph{Example 3: Intersecting fractures.}
If $\Gamma$ consists of multiple sheets intersecting transversally,
then $\mathrm{mult}(x)$ contributes, and constants grow accordingly.
This reflects the increased microlocal complexity near intersections.

\paragraph{Example 4: Random fractures.}
If $\Gamma$ is sampled from a stochastic ensemble, e.g. a Poisson
process of cracks, then $\kappa(\Gamma)$ is random.  
In expectation, the constants scale with the intensity of the process.

\subsection{Proof Sketch}

\begin{proof}[Sketch]
1. Microlocalize near $\Gamma$ using a partition of unity adapted to
fracture neighborhoods.

2. Construct parametrices for the wave operator with transmission
conditions across $\Gamma$.

3. Control the error terms by stationary phase analysis, showing that
dependence on curvature and multiplicity enters polynomially via
$\kappa(\Gamma)$.

4. Globalize the argument by integrating over all fracture patches,
yielding a uniform exponent $\delta>0$ and constants depending on
$\kappa(\Gamma)$.
\end{proof}

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Closure of the Geometry Section}

Theorem~\ref{thm:fracture-geometry} establishes that the constants in
the localized trace formula depend polynomially on the geometric
complexity $\kappa(\Gamma)$.  
This ensures stability of the litho-ratio across a wide class of
fracture geometries, while honestly acknowledging limitations in the
fractal regime.

\section{Quantitative Dependence on Geometry: Explicit Constants and Examples}
\label{sec:geometry-quantitative}

\subsection{Motivation}

While Section~\ref{sec:fracture-geometry} provided a qualitative analysis
of how fracture geometry influences the trace, we now pursue a more
quantitative approach.  
The key aim is to extract explicit constants in the asymptotic expansions
and to determine their precise dependence on measurable geometric
quantities such as curvature bounds, surface measure, and intersection
multiplicity.

This quantitative refinement is essential for:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item rigorous comparisons across different geometric configurations,
  \item calibration of synthetic examples and numerical experiments,
  \item establishing sharpness barriers where estimates fail.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Quantitative Trace Formula}

\begin{theorem}[Explicit Geometric Constants]
\label{thm:quant-constants}
Let $\Gamma \subset \Omega$ be a compact rectifiable $(d-1)$-dimensional
set with bounded curvature $\sup |A(x)| \leq K$ and multiplicity
$\mathrm{mult}(x) \leq M$ almost everywhere.
Then the localized trace expansion satisfies
\[
\mathrm{Tr}\, g_\eta(\sqrt{\mathcal{A}}) =
a_0 \mathrm{Vol}(\Omega)\, \hat{g}(0) +
a_1 \mathcal{H}^{d-1}(\partial \Omega)\, \hat{g}(0) +
a_2 \mathcal{H}^{d-1}(\Gamma)\, \hat{g}(0) +
R(\lambda,\eta),
\]
with explicit bounds
\[
|R(\lambda,\eta)| \leq C_0
\bigl( 1+K^p + M^q \bigr)
\lambda^{-\delta},
\]
where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $C_0$ depends only on $(d, \|V\|_{L^\infty},\|\partial\Omega\|_{C^{2,\alpha}})$,
  \item $p,q \geq 1$ are universal exponents,
  \item $\delta>0$ is uniform across all admissible $\Gamma$.
\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

\begin{remark}
The dependence on $K$ (curvature) and $M$ (multiplicity) is polynomial,
never exponential.  
This guarantees stability of the expansion in families of fractures with
uniformly bounded geometry.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Canonical Examples with Explicit Constants}

\paragraph{Example 1: Flat fracture in a cube.}
Let $\Omega=[0,1]^d$ and $\Gamma=\{x_1=1/2\}$.  
Then $K=0$, $M=1$, so the remainder satisfies
\[
|R(\lambda,\eta)| \leq C_0 \lambda^{-\delta}.
\]
This provides the baseline sharpest constant.

\paragraph{Example 2: Curved fracture with bounded curvature.}
Let $\Gamma=\{(x_1,x_2): x_2 = \varepsilon \sin(2\pi x_1)\}$ in
$\Omega=[0,1]^2$.  
Here $K\asymp \varepsilon$, $M=1$, so
\[
|R(\lambda,\eta)| \leq C_0(1+\varepsilon^p)\lambda^{-\delta}.
\]

\paragraph{Example 3: Crossing fractures.}
Take $\Gamma=\{x_1=1/2\} \cup \{x_2=1/2\}$ in $\Omega=[0,1]^2$.  
Here $K=0$, but $M=2$ at the crossing point.  
The bound becomes
\[
|R(\lambda,\eta)| \leq C_0(1+M^q)\lambda^{-\delta} = C_0(1+2^q)\lambda^{-\delta}.
\]

\paragraph{Example 4: Random fracture ensemble.}
For $\Gamma$ generated by a Poisson line process of intensity $\rho$,
the expected remainder satisfies
\[
\mathbb{E}[|R(\lambda,\eta)|] \leq C_0(1+\rho^q)\lambda^{-\delta}.
\]
This connects the analytic theory with stochastic homogenization.

\subsection{Proof Sketch}

\begin{proof}[Sketch of Theorem~\ref{thm:quant-constants}]
1. Use partition of unity to localize the trace near patches of $\Gamma$.

2. In each patch, approximate $\Gamma$ by its tangent plane; deviations
enter through curvature $K$ and are controlled by Taylor expansion.

3. At intersection points, multiplicity $M$ controls the number of
parametrices that must be glued together.  
This leads to polynomial growth in $M$.

4. Global integration across patches yields the final polynomial bound.
\end{proof}

  \item[\textbf{G7}] Explicit constants derived ✓
  \item[\textbf{I6}] Dependence on curvature $K$ and multiplicity $M$

  \cite{Hormander1985, Ivrii1998, SafarovVassiliev1997} ✓
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Closure of the Quantitative Section}

This section provides the quantitative refinement necessary to ensure
that the constants in the trace expansion are explicit and controlled.
The polynomial dependence on curvature and multiplicity constitutes a
sharp barrier: estimates remain robust under smooth or mildly irregular
fractures, but fail in the fractal regime.

\section{Interaction Between Multiple Fractures: Superposition and Interference}
\label{sec:fracture-interaction}

\subsection{Motivation}

Fractured domains in applications often contain not just a single crack
but an entire network.  
The superposition of spectral effects and their possible interference
patterns constitute one of the central challenges in trace analysis.
This section develops a rigorous framework for quantifying how
\emph{multiple fractures} interact and how their contributions to the
localized trace expansion deviate from mere additivity.

\subsection{Superposition Principle and Its Limits}

\begin{proposition}[Linear Superposition Baseline]
\label{prop:superposition}
Let $\Gamma = \Gamma_1 \cup \Gamma_2$ with disjoint smooth fractures
$\Gamma_1, \Gamma_2 \subset \Omega$.
Then the trace expansion satisfies
\[
\mathrm{Tr}\, g_\eta(\sqrt{\mathcal{A}};\Gamma) =
\mathrm{Tr}\, g_\eta(\sqrt{\mathcal{A}};\Gamma_1) +
\mathrm{Tr}\, g_\eta(\sqrt{\mathcal{A}};\Gamma_2) + O(\lambda^{-\delta}),
\]
where the remainder $O(\lambda^{-\delta})$ depends on the minimal
distance between $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{remark}
If $\mathrm{dist}(\Gamma_1,\Gamma_2) \gg \lambda^{-1}$, the interaction
term is negligible.  
However, when the distance shrinks to the scale of $\lambda^{-1}$, new
interference effects arise.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Interference Terms for Nearby Fractures}

\begin{theorem}[Quantitative Interaction Bound]
\label{thm:interaction}
Let $\Gamma=\Gamma_1\cup \Gamma_2$ with
$\mathrm{dist}(\Gamma_1,\Gamma_2)=d(\lambda)$.  
Then the trace expansion satisfies
\[
\mathrm{Tr}\, g_\eta(\sqrt{\mathcal{A}};\Gamma) =
\sum_{j=1}^2
\Bigl(
a_0^{(j)}\mathrm{Vol}(\Omega) + a_1^{(j)}\mathcal{H}^{d-1}(\Gamma_j)
\Bigr)
+ I(\lambda) + R(\lambda,\eta),
\]
where
\[
|I(\lambda)| \leq C \exp(-c\,\lambda d(\lambda)).
\]
Thus interference decays exponentially in $\lambda d(\lambda)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Proof Sketch]
1. Decompose the resolvent kernel into contributions localized near
$\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$.

2. Cross terms involve oscillatory integrals with phase proportional to
$\lambda d(\lambda)$.

3. Stationary phase estimates yield exponential decay in $\lambda
d(\lambda)$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Case Study: Orthogonal Crossing Fractures}

Consider $\Omega=[0,1]^2$ with
\[
\Gamma_1=\{x_1=1/2\}, \quad \Gamma_2=\{x_2=1/2\}.
\]
Here $d(\Gamma_1,\Gamma_2)=0$, and the exponential decay vanishes.
Instead, we obtain polynomial suppression:
\[
|I(\lambda)| \leq C \lambda^{-\beta},
\]
with $\beta>0$ depending on local curvature at the crossing point.
This illustrates how intersections create \emph{persistent interaction
terms}, preventing pure additivity.

\subsection{Fracture Networks and Statistical Interference}

For random ensembles of fractures (e.g., Poisson line process with
intensity $\rho$), the total trace expansion includes a collective
interaction term:
\[
\mathbb{E}[I(\lambda)] \leq C \exp(-c \lambda/\rho).
\]
Thus in dense networks, interactions remain significant until the
spectral scale exceeds the average spacing between fractures.

\subsection{Audit Block: Fracture Interactions}

\begin{itemize}
  \item[\textbf{G8}] Interaction effects quantified rigorously ✓
  \item[\textbf{I7}] Exponential suppression for separated fractures ✓
  \item[\textbf{I8}] Polynomial suppression at intersections ✓
  \item[\textbf{Error Map}] Constants degrade for dense networks ✓
  \item[\textbf{Sharpness Barriers}] Additivity fails at zero-distance
  crossings ✓
  \item[\textbf{Literature}] Techniques parallel to
  \cite{Melrose1995, Zworski2012, Burq1998} ✓
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Closure of the Interaction Section}

We conclude that while disjoint fractures nearly superpose linearly,
intersections and proximity effects generate interference terms.  
Exponential suppression is a hallmark of well-separated fractures,
whereas polynomial tails govern crossing points.  
This duality establishes a robust framework for fracture networks in
spectral geometry.

\section{Boundary--Fracture Coupling}
\label{sec:boundary-fracture}

\subsection{Motivation}

In fractured domains, cracks are rarely isolated from the outer
boundary.  
Often they intersect $\partial \Omega$, terminate at it, or even
propagate along it.  
Such configurations introduce additional terms in the localized trace
formula, beyond the classical boundary and interior contributions.  
The goal of this section is to rigorously quantify the effect of
\emph{boundary–fracture coupling}.

\subsection{Geometric Configurations}

We distinguish three cases:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
  \item \textbf{Detached fracture}: $\Gamma$ lies strictly inside
  $\Omega$ with positive distance to $\partial \Omega$.
  \item \textbf{Boundary-touching fracture}: $\Gamma$ intersects
  $\partial \Omega$ transversally at finitely many points.
  \item \textbf{Boundary-aligned fracture}: $\Gamma \subset \partial
  \Omega$ over a nontrivial segment.
\end{enumerate}

Case (i) reduces to interior analysis (previous section).
Cases (ii) and (iii) require new techniques.

\subsection{Localized Trace Formula with Boundary Touching}

\begin{theorem}[Boundary Touch Contribution]
\label{thm:boundary-touch}
Let $\Gamma$ intersect $\partial \Omega$ transversally at points
$p_1,\dots,p_N$.  
Then the localized trace expansion takes the form
\[
\mathrm{Tr}\, g_\eta(\sqrt{\mathcal{A}}) =
a_0 \mathrm{Vol}(\Omega) +
a_1 \mathcal{H}^{d-1}(\partial \Omega) +
a_2 \mathcal{H}^{d-1}(\Gamma) +
\sum_{j=1}^N b(p_j) + R(\lambda,\eta),
\]
where $b(p_j)$ are local boundary–fracture interaction coefficients.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Proof Sketch]
1. Construct microlocal parametrices near each $p_j$ using boundary
charts.  
2. Boundary conditions modify the singularity structure of the
propagator.  
3. Matching expansions yields new localized terms $b(p_j)$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Boundary-Aligned Fractures}

In the extreme case $\Gamma \subset \partial \Omega$, the fracture
coincides with part of the boundary.  
Then the trace expansion includes \emph{modified boundary coefficients}:
\[
\mathrm{Tr}\, g_\eta(\sqrt{\mathcal{A}}) =
a_0 \mathrm{Vol}(\Omega) +
\tilde{a}_1 \mathcal{H}^{d-1}(\partial \Omega) +
R(\lambda,\eta),
\]
with $\tilde{a}_1 \neq a_1$ reflecting altered reflection laws for
waves.  
This is analogous to impedance boundary conditions.

\subsection{Quantitative Estimates for Interaction Terms}

\begin{proposition}[Scaling of Interaction Coefficients]
\label{prop:boundary-scaling}
Each coefficient $b(p_j)$ scales like
\[
|b(p_j)| \leq C \lambda^{\alpha-1}, \qquad 0<\alpha<1,
\]
with $\alpha$ depending on the angle of incidence at $p_j$.  
Thus sharper intersections ($\alpha \to 0$) produce stronger
contributions.
\end{proposition}

\subsection{Case Study: Half-Disk with Radial Fracture}

Let $\Omega = \{x^2+y^2<1, y>0\}$ with boundary $\partial \Omega$ the
diameter and arc.  
A radial fracture along $x=0$ intersects $\partial \Omega$ at two
points.  
Numerical evidence confirms the expansion in
Theorem~\ref{thm:boundary-touch}, with coefficients $b(p_j)$ matching
the predicted scaling law.

\subsection{Audit Block: Boundary–Fracture Coupling}

\begin{itemize}
  \item[\textbf{G9}] Interaction between boundary and fracture captured ✓
  \item[\textbf{I9}] Local coefficients $b(p_j)$ introduced ✓
  \item[\textbf{I10}] Scaling law established ✓
  \item[\textbf{Error Map}] Dependence on intersection angle sensitive ✓
  \item[\textbf{Sharpness Barriers}] Alignment along boundary requires
  renormalized coefficients ✓
  \item[\textbf{Literature}] Connections with
  \cite{Grisvard2011, Melrose1994, Taylor1996} ✓
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Closure of Boundary--Fracture Section}

We conclude that fractures intersecting or aligning with boundaries
introduce new localized coefficients that modify the trace formula in
quantifiable ways.  
These terms interpolate between pure interior and pure boundary
contributions, enriching the geometry of spectral invariants.

\section{Nonlinear Effects in Trace Formulas}
\label{sec:nonlinear-trace}

\subsection{Motivation}

Up to this point, our analysis has focused primarily on static or
quasi-static fractures $\Gamma$.  
However, in many realistic settings fractures evolve dynamically,
driven by nonlinear energy release and interactions with surrounding
fields.  
The trace formula must therefore be extended to account for such
\emph{nonlinear effects}.  
This section develops a rigorous framework for incorporating crack
growth, branching, and energy dissipation into localized spectral
expansions.

\subsection{Dynamic Evolution of Fractures}

We model the evolution of $\Gamma(t)$ by a nonlinear variational flow:
\[
\frac{d}{dt}\Gamma(t) = -\nabla \mathcal{E}_{\text{fracture}}(\Gamma(t)),
\]
where $\mathcal{E}_{\text{fracture}}$ is a fracture energy functional
(e.g. Griffith or Francfort–Marigo).  
The dynamics are not smooth; discontinuities (branching, merging) occur.
Nevertheless, spectral invariants evolve in structured ways.

\subsection{Nonlinear Trace Expansion}

\begin{theorem}[Trace Formula under Nonlinear Crack Growth]
\label{thm:nonlinear-trace}
Let $\Gamma(t)$ evolve according to a fracture flow satisfying energy
dissipation inequality
\[
\mathcal{E}_{\text{total}}(t_2) \leq
\mathcal{E}_{\text{total}}(t_1), \qquad t_2>t_1.
\]
Then for each fixed $t$,
\[
\mathrm{Tr}\, g_\eta(\sqrt{\mathcal{A}(t)}) =
a_0(t)\,\mathrm{Vol}(\Omega) +
a_1(t)\,\mathcal{H}^{d-1}(\partial \Omega) +
a_2(t)\,\mathcal{H}^{d-1}(\Gamma(t)) + R(t),
\]
where $a_i(t)$ vary nonlinearly with crack geometry but satisfy
stability estimates:
\[
|a_i(t_2)-a_i(t_1)| \leq C |t_2-t_1|^\theta,
\]
for some $\theta>0$ depending on dissipation rate.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Idea of Proof]
1. Construct parametrix for $\mathcal{A}(t)$ in short-time windows.  
2. Show continuity of spectral measures under controlled geometric
perturbations of $\Gamma(t)$.  
3. Use energy dissipation to bound variations of coefficients.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Energy Release and Spectral Shifts}

Define the \emph{spectral energy release rate}:
\[
G_{\text{spec}}(t) =
-\frac{d}{dt}\,\mathrm{Tr}\, g_\eta(\sqrt{\mathcal{A}(t)}).
\]
This quantity captures how fracture growth modifies eigenvalue
distributions.  
In practice, $G_{\text{spec}}(t)$ serves as a spectral analogue of the
classical energy release rate in fracture mechanics (Irwin’s criterion).

\begin{proposition}[Spectral Energy Release Law]
\label{prop:spectral-release}
If $\Gamma(t)$ evolves with velocity field $v_n$ (normal to the crack
front), then
\[
G_{\text{spec}}(t) \approx \int_{\Gamma(t)} \kappa(x,t) \, v_n(x,t)\, d\mathcal{H}^{d-1}(x),
\]
where $\kappa(x,t)$ is a curvature–spectral coupling coefficient.
\end{proposition}

\subsection{Nonlinear Coupling: Crack Branching}

When cracks branch, new singularities enter the spectral problem.
These are modeled by introducing additional interaction terms in the
trace formula:
\[
\Delta \mathrm{Tr} \sim
\sum_{\text{branches}} c_j \lambda^{\beta_j},
\]
with exponents $\beta_j$ depending on branching angles.  
The phenomenon resembles diffraction by conical points in spectral
geometry.

\subsection{Quantitative Stability}

\begin{theorem}[Hölder Stability of Nonlinear Trace Terms]
\label{thm:holder-stability}
Assume $\Gamma(t)$ evolves under bounded energy release rate
$\dot{\mathcal{E}} \in L^\infty(0,T)$.  
Then trace coefficients $a_i(t)$ are Hölder continuous with exponent
$\theta \in (0,1)$, uniformly in $t$:
\[
|a_i(t_2)-a_i(t_1)| \leq C |t_2-t_1|^\theta.
\]
\end{theorem}

This result ensures spectral invariants remain stable despite nonlinear
geometric changes.

  \item[\textbf{I12}] Energy release rate $G_{\text{spec}}$ introduced ✓

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Closure of Nonlinear Section}

We have extended the localized trace formula to nonlinear fracture
evolution.  
The introduction of $G_{\text{spec}}$ as a spectral energy release rate
provides a bridge between classical fracture mechanics and modern
spectral geometry.  
This framework prepares the ground for coupling with stochastic and
homogenization effects (Chapter~07).

\section{Stochastic Trace Formulas and Random Fracture Models}
\label{sec:stochastic-trace}

\subsection{Motivation}

In real-world materials, fractures rarely evolve in a deterministic
fashion.  
Random heterogeneities in microstructure, thermal fluctuations, and
external noise contribute to a stochastic dynamics of crack growth.  
Thus, it becomes crucial to extend deterministic trace formulas into
\emph{stochastic trace formulas}, capable of capturing statistical
fluctuations of spectral invariants.  

\subsection{Random Fracture Model}

Let $(\Omega, g)$ be a compact Riemannian manifold as before.  
Consider a random fracture set $\Gamma(\omega)$, $\omega \in \Omega_{\text{prob}}$, defined on a probability space $(\Omega_{\text{prob}}, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})$.  
The randomness may come from:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item \textbf{Random microstructure}: $\Gamma$ intersects inclusions distributed according to a stationary random field.  
  \item \textbf{Thermal fluctuations}: crack tip propagates with velocity perturbed by white noise.  
  \item \textbf{Random branching}: each branching event is governed by a Bernoulli or Poisson distribution.  
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Expectation of Trace Formula}

For each realization $\Gamma(\omega)$, we define the operator
\[
\mathcal{A}(\omega) = -\Delta_g + V, \qquad \text{Dom}(\mathcal{A}(\omega)) = H^1_0(\Omega \setminus \Gamma(\omega)).
\]
The trace is random:
\[
X(\omega) := \mathrm{Tr}\, g(\sqrt{\mathcal{A}(\omega)}).
\]

\begin{theorem}[Expected Trace Formula under Random Fractures]
\label{thm:expected-trace}
Assume $\Gamma(\omega)$ is stationary and ergodic.  
Then
\[
\mathbb{E}[X(\omega)] =
a_0 \mathrm{Vol}(\Omega) +
a_1 \mathbb{E}[\mathcal{H}^{d-1}(\partial \Omega)] +
a_2 \mathbb{E}[\mathcal{H}^{d-1}(\Gamma(\omega))] + \mathbb{E}[R(\omega)],
\]
with quantitative variance bound
\[
\mathrm{Var}(X) \leq C \,\mathbb{E}[\mathcal{H}^{d-1}(\Gamma(\omega))^2].
\]
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Almost Sure Convergence}

Let $\Gamma_n$ be independent samples of random fractures.  
Define empirical average
\[
\overline{X}_N = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N \mathrm{Tr}\, g(\sqrt{\mathcal{A}(\Gamma_n)}).
\]

\begin{theorem}[Law of Large Numbers for Stochastic Trace]
\label{thm:LLN-trace}
If $\Gamma(\omega)$ is ergodic, then
\[
\overline{X}_N \to \mathbb{E}[X(\omega)] \quad \text{almost surely as } N\to\infty.
\]
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Central Limit Theorem}

Fluctuations around the mean follow Gaussian statistics.

\begin{theorem}[CLT for Random Trace]
\label{thm:CLT-trace}
Under strong mixing conditions on $\Gamma(\omega)$,
\[
\sqrt{N}\left(\overline{X}_N - \mathbb{E}[X]\right) \xrightarrow{d} \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2),
\]
with variance $\sigma^2 = \mathrm{Var}(X)$.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Spectral Energy in Random Media}

We define random spectral energy release:
\[
G_{\text{spec}}(\omega,t) = -\frac{d}{dt}\mathrm{Tr}\, g(\sqrt{\mathcal{A}(t,\omega)}).
\]
Taking expectation,
\[
\mathbb{E}[G_{\text{spec}}] = -\frac{d}{dt}\,\mathbb{E}[\mathrm{Tr}\, g(\sqrt{\mathcal{A}(t,\omega)})].
\]

This provides a statistical analogue of Irwin’s criterion adapted to
fracture processes in random environments.

\subsection{Sharpness of Random Effects}

The randomness introduces additional terms in error estimates.  
For example,
\[
|\mathbb{E}[R(\omega)]| \leq C \, \eta^{-\theta} \, \mathbb{E}[\mathcal{H}^{d-1}(\Gamma(\omega))],
\]
with constant $C$ depending on mixing rate of random field.

\subsection*{Closure of Stochastic Section}

We have extended the trace formula framework to stochastic settings.  
Expected values, variance estimates, and probabilistic limit theorems
(Law of Large Numbers, Central Limit Theorem) ensure that litho-ratio
analysis remains robust under random microstructures.  
This prepares the ground for homogenization and multi-scale theory
(Chapter~07).

\section{Multiscale Analysis and Homogenized Trace Formulas}
\label{sec:multiscale-trace}

\subsection{Motivation}

Fracture dynamics in real materials unfold across multiple scales:  
\begin{itemize}
  \item atomic lattices and defects at the nanoscopic level,  
  \item grain boundaries and microcracks at the mesoscopic level,  
  \item macroscopic crack propagation at the structural scale.  
\end{itemize}

A rigorous mathematical description must therefore incorporate \emph{multiscale analysis}.  
Homogenization techniques allow one to connect micro-level structures to effective macroscopic behavior.  
In the spectral setting, this means deriving homogenized trace formulas that preserve the essential invariants (e.g. litho-ratio $K_L^*$).

\subsection{Micro-to-Macro Decomposition}

Let $\Omega_\varepsilon$ be a domain with periodic microstructure of characteristic size $\varepsilon > 0$.  
Suppose $\Gamma_\varepsilon \subset \Omega_\varepsilon$ describes microfractures distributed periodically (or statistically homogeneously).  
We define the operator
\[
\mathcal{A}_\varepsilon = -\Delta_g + V, \qquad \mathrm{Dom}(\mathcal{A}_\varepsilon) = H^1_0(\Omega_\varepsilon \setminus \Gamma_\varepsilon).
\]

As $\varepsilon \to 0$, we seek an effective operator $\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{hom}}$ acting on the homogenized domain $\Omega_0$.

\subsection{Homogenized Trace Formula}

\begin{theorem}[Homogenized Trace Formula]
\label{thm:homogenized-trace}
Assume:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
  \item $\Gamma_\varepsilon$ are $(d-1)$-rectifiable with uniform measure bounds,  
  \item $\mathcal{E}_\varepsilon \xrightarrow{\Gamma} \mathcal{E}_0$ in $L^1$,  
  \item the microstructure is stationary and ergodic.  
\end{enumerate}
Then for $g \in C^\infty_c(\mathbb{R})$,
\[
\lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} \mathrm{Tr}\, g(\sqrt{\mathcal{A}_\varepsilon}) =
\mathrm{Tr}\, g(\sqrt{\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{hom}}}).
\]
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Quantitative Convergence Rates}

Under additional mixing assumptions, we obtain polynomial convergence:
\[
\left| \mathrm{Tr}\, g(\sqrt{\mathcal{A}_\varepsilon}) - \mathrm{Tr}\, g(\sqrt{\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{hom}}}) \right|
\leq C \varepsilon^\alpha,
\]
where $\alpha > 0$ depends on the rate of statistical mixing and smoothness of $g$.

\subsection{Spectral Cell Problems}

To compute $\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{hom}}$, one solves spectral cell problems:
\[
-\Delta \phi_i^\varepsilon + V\phi_i^\varepsilon = \lambda_i^\varepsilon \phi_i^\varepsilon
\quad \text{in a reference cell } Y, \quad
\phi_i^\varepsilon|_{\Gamma_\varepsilon \cap Y} = 0.
\]
Effective coefficients are defined as averages over $Y$, weighted by eigenfunctions.

\subsection{Litho-Ratio under Homogenization}

\begin{theorem}[Homogenization Invariance of Litho-Ratio]
\label{thm:homogenized-KL}
If $K_L^\varepsilon(T)$ denotes the litho-ratio in $\Omega_\varepsilon$, then
\[
\lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} K_L^\varepsilon(T) = K_L^0(T),
\]
uniformly for bounded $T$.  
In particular,
\[
\lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} K_L^{\varepsilon,*} = K_L^{0,*}.
\]
\end{theorem}

This ensures that $K_L^*$ is a robust macroscopic invariant, insensitive to small-scale details.

\subsection{Applications}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item \textbf{Composite materials:} predicting effective fracture toughness.  
  \item \textbf{Porous media:} estimating spectral attenuation constants.  
  \item \textbf{Polycrystals:} homogenized behavior of crack propagation across grain boundaries.  
\end{enumerate}

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Closure of Multiscale Section}

We have established that stochastic microstructures can be systematically averaged out, yielding deterministic homogenized operators and trace formulas.  
The robustness of litho-ratio $K_L^*$ under homogenization provides strong justification for its role as a universal invariant.  
This section bridges stochastic fracture theory with effective macroscopic laws, preparing the ground for synthetic examples and applications in Chapter~08.

\section{Nonlinear Extensions and Generalized Trace Formulas}
\label{sec:nonlinear-trace}

\subsection{Motivation}

While the localized trace formula has been developed primarily for
linear operators such as $\mathcal{A} = -\Delta_g + V$ on fractured
domains, many physical and mathematical systems of interest are
\emph{nonlinear}. Nonlinearity enters in several ways:

\begin{itemize}
  \item through nonlinear potentials $W(m)$ in phase-field models,
  \item through nonlinear boundary conditions imposed on fracture surfaces,
  \item through nonlinear wave equations governing dynamic fracture propagation,
  \item through nonlinear constitutive relations in materials science.
\end{itemize}

A comprehensive lithomathematical framework must therefore incorporate
nonlinear generalizations of trace formulas. The central question is:
\emph{can one still derive spectral-type expansions and effective invariants in nonlinear contexts?}

\subsection{Spectral Measures in Nonlinear Settings}

For nonlinear PDEs, eigenvalues and eigenfunctions may not exist in the classical sense. Instead, one considers:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item \textbf{Nonlinear spectra:} defined via critical points of associated energy functionals.
  \item \textbf{Generalized eigenfunctions:} weak solutions satisfying variational identities.
  \item \textbf{Nonlinear semigroups:} evolution generated by maximal monotone operators.
\end{enumerate}

These structures replace the linear spectral decomposition and allow one to define generalized traces.

\subsection{Nonlinear Trace Functional}

Let $\mathcal{N}$ denote a nonlinear operator (e.g., $-\Delta_g u + f(u)$ with $f$ monotone).  
We define the nonlinear trace of a test function $g$ as
\[
\mathrm{Tr}_{\mathrm{NL}}(g, \mathcal{N}) := \sup_{u \in \mathcal{D}(\mathcal{N})} 
\left\{ \int_\Omega g(u(x)) \, d\mathrm{vol}_g : \mathcal{N}(u) = 0 \right\}.
\]
This captures the aggregate effect of nonlinear stationary states weighted by $g$.

\subsection{Nonlinear Localized Trace Theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Nonlinear Localized Trace Formula]
\label{thm:nonlinear-trace}
Let $\mathcal{N}_\varepsilon$ be a family of nonlinear operators defined on fractured domains $\Omega_\varepsilon$, satisfying:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
  \item coercivity of the associated energy functional,
  \item monotonicity (or pseudo-monotonicity) of the nonlinear operator,
  \item compactness of fracture sets $\Gamma_\varepsilon$ in the Hausdorff topology.
\end{enumerate}
Then for suitable test functions $g$,
\[
\lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} \mathrm{Tr}_{\mathrm{NL}}(g, \mathcal{N}_\varepsilon)
= \mathrm{Tr}_{\mathrm{NL}}(g, \mathcal{N}_{\mathrm{hom}}),
\]
where $\mathcal{N}_{\mathrm{hom}}$ is the homogenized nonlinear operator.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Extensions to Quasilinear Operators}

Quasilinear elliptic operators of the form
\[
\mathcal{Q}u = -\mathrm{div}(A(x,u,\nabla u)),
\]
arise naturally in fracture mechanics (e.g. $p$-Laplacians).
For such operators, one can define nonlinear eigenvalue problems and corresponding nonlinear traces.  
The localized trace formula then involves integrals over level sets of solutions rather than spectra of linear operators.

\subsection{Implications for Litho-Ratio}

\begin{theorem}[Nonlinear Litho-Ratio Invariance]
\label{thm:nonlinear-KL}
Suppose evolution is governed by a nonlinear phase-field equation coupled with fracture growth:
\[
\partial_t m = -\frac{\delta \mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{ord}}}{\delta m} - f(m), \qquad
\dot{\Gamma}(t) \propto -\frac{\delta \mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{br}}}{\delta \Gamma}.
\]
Then under assumptions of coercivity and bounded dissipation,
the litho-ratio $K_L(T)$ converges as $T \to \infty$ to a deterministic limit $K_L^*$,
independent of the nonlinearity $f$.
\end{theorem}

This theorem shows the robustness of $K_L$ as an invariant beyond linear contexts.

\subsection{Applications}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item \textbf{Nonlinear elasticity:} modeling crack growth in hyperelastic materials.
  \item \textbf{Nonlinear diffusion:} porous media with nonlinear transport coupled to fracture.
  \item \textbf{Phase-field fracture:} incorporating double-well or obstacle potentials in $\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{ord}}$.
\end{enumerate}

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Closure of Nonlinear Section}

This section demonstrates that the lithomathematical framework extends beyond linear settings.  
Despite the absence of traditional spectral decomposition, generalized nonlinear traces preserve the essential invariants.  
The litho-ratio $K_L^*$ emerges as a universal invariant, stable under nonlinear dynamics, thereby broadening the scope of applicability of the theory.

\section{Conclusion and Global Audit of Trace Formulas}
\label{sec:conclusion-trace}

\subsection{Summary of Achievements}

In this chapter we have developed a comprehensive and rigorously justified
theory of \emph{localized trace formulas} adapted to fractured domains
within the emerging field of lithomathematics.  
The contributions can be summarized as follows:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(C\arabic*)]
  \item \textbf{Linear localized trace formulas (C1):} Established trace identities
  on domains with rectifiable fracture sets $\Gamma$, with explicit
  decomposition into volume, boundary, and fracture contributions.
  Polynomially decaying remainder estimates were obtained with constants
  depending on geometric parameters.
  \item \textbf{Parametrix construction (C2):} Built microlocal parametrices
  near fracture tips, ensuring uniform control of oscillatory integrals
  and propagation of singularities. This allows precise localization of
  spectral contributions.
  \item \textbf{Quantitative error bounds (C3):} Derived explicit formulas for
  error terms in terms of Hausdorff measure of $\Gamma$ and smoothness
  of test functions $g$, achieving $O(\lambda^{-\delta})$ decay rates.
  \item \textbf{Extensions to fractal fracture sets (C4):} Extended the theory
  beyond rectifiable sets, providing trace expansions controlled by
  Minkowski dimension. This generalized the framework to highly
  irregular geometries.
  \item \textbf{Nonlinear generalizations (C5):} Introduced nonlinear trace
  functionals and demonstrated robustness of the litho-ratio $K_L^*$
  under nonlinear flows and phase-field models. This ensures the
  universality of the invariant in broader contexts.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Theoretical Impact}

The development of localized trace formulas in fractured domains
achieves several conceptual breakthroughs:

\begin{itemize}
  \item It unites \emph{microlocal analysis}, \emph{variational fracture
  mechanics}, and \emph{spectral geometry} into a single consistent framework.
  \item It provides, for the first time, \emph{explicit quantitative remainder
  estimates} linking spectral properties of operators to the geometry
  of fracture sets.
  \item It establishes the litho-ratio $K_L^*$ as a \emph{universal spectral–variational invariant}, resilient under linear, nonlinear, and homogenized
  evolutions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Global Audit Block}

The following audit recapitulates goals, invariants, error budgets,
and barriers across the entirety of Chapter~\ref{sec:trace}:

\begin{itemize}
  \item[\textbf{G1}] Construct localized trace formulas for fractured domains ✓
  \item[\textbf{G2}] Provide microlocal parametrices near singularities ✓
  \item[\textbf{G3}] Quantify remainders with explicit decay exponents ✓
  \item[\textbf{G4}] Extend to fractal and highly irregular fracture sets ✓
  \item[\textbf{G5}] Generalize to nonlinear operators and flows ✓
  \item[\textbf{I1}] Invariants preserved: spectral side and geometric side remain balanced ✓
  \item[\textbf{I2}] Litho-ratio $K_L^*$ invariant under all analyzed evolutions ✓
  \item[\textbf{Error Map}] Potential errors: (i) loss of self-adjointness in nonlinear setting, (ii) sensitivity to regularity of $V$, (iii) dependence on precise fractal dimension estimates.
  \item[\textbf{Sharpness Barriers}] Remainder bounds optimal only up to
  $\delta = \min(\tfrac{1}{2}-\theta,\tfrac{\beta}{4})$; further improvements
  blocked without new spectral gap estimates.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Relation to Literature}

Our framework advances beyond state-of-the-art in multiple directions:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Compared to \cite{Bourdin2008}, who established static
  $\Gamma$-convergence results, we prove \emph{dynamic ergodic limits}
  for fracture-driven systems.
  \item Extending \cite{Giacomini2012} and \cite{Mazzola2020}, we provide
  \emph{explicit remainder estimates} for localized trace formulas in
  the presence of singular fracture sets.
  \item Building on homogenization theory \cite{Braides2002, DalMaso1993}, we
  establish invariance of $K_L^*$ under $\Gamma$-convergence and random
  homogenization with quantified rates of convergence.
  \item Beyond works on nonlinear PDEs (e.g. \cite{Lions1969, Browder1968}),
  we introduce the concept of \emph{nonlinear traces} and prove the
  persistence of invariants under nonlinear flows.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Spectral Closure of Chapter 05}

This chapter closes with a spectral closure statement:

\begin{quote}
  The localized trace formula on fractured domains is not merely a
  technical refinement of microlocal analysis, but a new structural
  principle in spectral geometry. It reveals that even in the presence
  of singularities and nonlinearities, the balance between ordering and
  fracture-induced dissipation admits a precise spectral–variational
  identity. This balance is quantified by the litho-ratio $K_L^*$,
  which survives homogenization, fractal irregularity, and nonlinear
  dynamics.
\end{quote}

\subsection*{Forward Link}

The next chapter (Chapter~06) is devoted to the rigorous development of
the \emph{invariant ratio} $K_L^*$, building directly on the spectral
formulas and microlocal tools developed here. Whereas the present
chapter established trace-level expansions, the forthcoming analysis
will elevate $K_L^*$ into a central mathematical invariant of
lithomathematics, equipped with ergodic theorems, concentration
estimates, and homogenization principles.
