\section{Overview and Motivation}

Classical spectral geometry, inaugurated by Weyl’s law and developed through 
the work of Ivrii and Safarov–Vassiliev, explains how the large–frequency 
spectrum of the Laplace operator reflects the geometry and dynamics of smooth 
domains and manifolds with boundary; see, e.g., \cite{weyl1911,ivrii1980,
safarov-vassiliev1997}. In this smooth setting the eigenvalue counting function 
and localized spectral traces admit asymptotic expansions whose coefficients 
are explicit geometric functionals (volume, area of the boundary, curvature 
corrections), and whose remainders are controlled by microlocal and dynamical 
information.

Many natural media, however, are not smooth: in addition to an exterior 
boundary, they contain \emph{internal} codimension–one defects—interfaces, 
cuts, or fracture sets—along which waves reflect, mode–convert, and diffract. 
From the analytic point of view, the presence of an internal fracture 
$\Gamma\subset\Omega$ forces a mixed “interior boundary condition’’ on the 
operator, and creates new families of (diffractive) geodesics that are 
invisible to the classical Weyl–Ivrii analysis. In this regime the standard 
toolkit (smooth boundary parametrix, propagation of singularities away from 
corners/edges) is insufficient: even the right \emph{objects} that should enter 
the spectral coefficients and the correct \emph{scales} for remainders must be 
identified.

The purpose of this monograph is to provide a complete analytic and microlocal 
foundation for spectral geometry on domains with internal fracture sets. 
Concretely, we work with a compact Riemannian manifold $(\Omega,g)$ with smooth 
exterior boundary $\partial\Omega$ and a closed codimension–one subset 
$\Gamma\subset\Omega$ of adequate regularity. We develop localized trace 
expansions for the Dirichlet Laplacian on $\Omega\setminus\Gamma$ with a 
\emph{new} explicit contribution supported on $\Gamma$; we quantify the 
dependence of all constants on a geometric “complexity’’ parameter 
$\kappa(\Gamma)$; and we introduce a \emph{spectral ratio} $K_L$ (defined via 
trace coefficients) that measures the relative spectral weight of the fracture 
term. We further establish a universality law for $K_L$ in ergodic ensembles of 
fracture sets.

\subsection*{Guiding Principles}

Two principles guide our construction.

\begin{description}
  \item[(P1) Explicit locality at the fracture.]  
  All new terms—both the coefficient supported on $\Gamma$ and the additional 
  singular components of the wave kernel—are localized microlocally near the 
  conormal to $\Gamma$. This allows us to write the fracture contribution as an 
  explicit surface integral along $\Gamma$ with a density determined by the 
  symbol of an adapted parametrix and the second fundamental form of $\Gamma$.

  \item[(P2) Stable globalization with quantitative error control.]  
  We propagate the local microlocal information to global spectral asymptotics 
  by means of Tauberian arguments \emph{with explicit constants}. This yields 
  remainder bounds whose dependence on $\Gamma$ is polynomial in 
  $\kappa(\Gamma)$, and whose exponents are sharp under our standing geometric 
  hypotheses; under additional dynamical assumptions (exponential mixing of the 
  fractured geodesic flow) we obtain genuine power savings.
\end{description}

The resulting theory extends the Weyl–Ivrii–Safarov–Vassiliev paradigm to an 
analytically controlled class of singular geometries. At the same time, it is 
orthogonal to the variational literature on brittle fracture (Griffith, 
Ambrosio–Tortorelli, Francfort–Marigo): that tradition studies \emph{evolution} 
and energy minimization; here we study \emph{spectral invariants} of a fixed 
fractured configuration. The approaches are complementary.

\subsection*{Main Contributions (Informal)}

To orient the reader, we summarize the four principal outputs; precise 
statements appear later in this chapter.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{A localized trace formula on fractured domains} with an explicit 
  fracture coefficient 
  \[
  A_\Gamma(g)=\int_\Gamma \alpha_g(x)\,d\mathcal H^{d-1}(x),
  \]
  and a remainder bounded by $T^{d-2}\log(1+T)$ up to explicit constants 
  polynomial in $\kappa(\Gamma)$.

  \item \emph{A geometric complexity parameter} $\kappa(\Gamma)$ capturing size, 
  curvature, and topological fragmentation of $\Gamma$; all constants in the 
  expansions and error terms are controlled polynomially in $\kappa(\Gamma)$.

  \item \emph{Power–saving refinements} of the remainder under exponential 
  mixing of the fractured geodesic flow, with an exponent $\delta>0$ determined 
  by the mixing rate and proved optimal in our setting.

  \item \emph{A universality law} for a trace–based spectral ratio $K_L$: in 
  ergodic ensembles of fracture sets it converges almost surely to a 
  deterministic limit and satisfies a central limit theorem at scale $N^{-1/2}$ 
  for i.i.d.\ sampling.
\end{itemize}

\section{Objectives of the Monograph}

We record the concrete objectives that will be met in the later chapters. 
Throughout, $d\ge2$ is fixed, $g\in C_c^\infty(\mathbb R^+)$ is even with 
$\mathrm{supp}\,g\subset[0,T]$, and $\Delta_\Gamma$ denotes the Dirichlet 
Laplacian on $\Omega\setminus\Gamma$.

\begin{itemize}
  \item[\textbf{O1}] \textbf{Localized trace expansion.}  
  Prove that
  \[
     \operatorname{Tr}\big(g(\sqrt{-\Delta_\Gamma})\big)
      = A_{\mathrm{vol}}(g)+A_{\partial\Omega}(g)+A_\Gamma(g)+R(g,T),
  \]
  with $A_{\mathrm{vol}},A_{\partial\Omega}$ equal to the classical Weyl 
  coefficients, and with
  \[
  A_\Gamma(g)=\int_\Gamma \alpha_g(x)\,d\mathcal H^{d-1}(x),
  \qquad 
  |R(g,T)|\le C(\Omega)\,P(\kappa(\Gamma))\,\|g\|_{C^{d+3}}\,T^{d-2}\log(1+T),
  \]
  where $P$ is a dimension–dependent polynomial and the exponent of $T$ is 
  optimal under the standing geometric assumptions.

  \item[\textbf{O2}] \textbf{Complexity control.}  
  Introduce a quantitative geometric parameter $\kappa(\Gamma)$ 
  (Definition~\ref{def:kappa} below) and show that all constants in the trace 
  coefficients and remainder bounds are polynomially controlled by 
  $\kappa(\Gamma)$, uniformly over admissible $\Gamma$.

  \item[\textbf{O3}] \textbf{Dynamical refinements.}  
  Under exponential mixing of the fractured geodesic flow with rate $\beta>0$, 
  improve the remainder to $T^{d-2-\delta+\varepsilon}$ for any $\varepsilon>0$, 
  with $\delta=\delta(\beta)>0$ explicit and optimal within this dynamical 
  class.

  \item[\textbf{O4}] \textbf{Spectral ratio and universality.}  
  Define the litho–ratio $K_L$ via trace coefficients (Definition~\ref{def:KL}) 
  and prove that in ergodic ensembles of fracture sets $K_L$ converges almost 
  surely to a deterministic limit $K_L^\ast$ and satisfies a central limit 
  theorem with variance depending on $d$, the normalization of $g$, and the 
  ensemble.

  \item[\textbf{O5}] \textbf{Reproducibility and explicit constants.}  
  Keep track of constants at each step (parametrix construction, Tauberian 
  arguments, dynamical inputs), ensuring that all statements are quantitatively 
  reproducible and that dependence on $\kappa(\Gamma)$ is transparent.
\end{itemize}

\section{Scope, Non–Goals, and Design Choices}

To avoid ambiguity we record scope decisions that shape the presentation.

\paragraph{Scope.}  
We work with fracture sets that are $(d\!-\!1)$-rectifiable and $C^2$ almost 
everywhere, ensuring that the second fundamental form $II$ exists 
$\mathcal H^{d-1}$-a.e.\ and that diffractive microlocal analysis can be carried 
out with quantitative control. The exterior boundary $\partial\Omega$ is 
smooth; the metric $g$ is smooth up to $\partial\Omega$ and across $\Gamma$.

\paragraph{Non–Goals.}  
We do not pursue applications to fracture growth, numerical phase–field models, 
or inverse problems. We also refrain from treating highly irregular (fractal) 
cracks, polyhedral corners meeting $\Gamma$, and non–Dirichlet boundary 
conditions; these are natural but technically substantial extensions left for 
future work. Likewise, we avoid heuristic “physical’’ normalizations for the 
trace and stick to the analytic normalizations standard in spectral geometry.

\paragraph{Design choices.}  
All localized trace statements are formulated for even test functions 
$g\in C_c^\infty(\mathbb R^+)$ supported in $[0,T]$; Tauberian equivalences to 
counting–function statements are developed later (Chapter~\ref{chap:trace}). 
The fracture contribution is always expressed as a $\Gamma$–surface integral 
with a density $\alpha_g$ computed from an adapted parametrix; the remainder is 
controlled by an explicit polynomial in $\kappa(\Gamma)$ and the $C^{d+3}$–norm 
of $g$.

%==============================================================================

\section{Historical Context and Literature Survey}

The systematic analysis of spectral asymptotics has its origins in Weyl’s law 
for the eigenvalue counting function of the Laplacian on bounded Euclidean 
domains. For a bounded smooth domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^d$ with Dirichlet 
boundary conditions, Weyl established in 1911 that
\[
  N(\lambda) := \#\{j:\,\lambda_j\le \lambda\}
  = C_d\,\mathrm{vol}(\Omega)\,\lambda^{d/2} + o(\lambda^{d/2}),
  \qquad \lambda\to\infty,
\]
where $\lambda_j$ are the eigenvalues of $-\Delta$ and 
$C_d=(2\pi)^{-d}\omega_d$ with $\omega_d$ the volume of the unit ball in 
$\mathbb R^d$. This result established the first bridge between geometry and 
spectral theory.

\subsection{Refinements of Weyl’s Law}

Later refinements due to Ivrii and others included the boundary correction 
term:
\[
  N(\lambda) = C_d\,\mathrm{vol}(\Omega)\,\lambda^{d/2}
    - C_{d-1}\,\mathrm{vol}(\partial\Omega)\,\lambda^{(d-1)/2}
    + o(\lambda^{(d-1)/2}).
\]
Here the coefficient $C_{d-1}$ depends only on the dimension and on the chosen 
boundary condition (Dirichlet or Neumann). These refinements made explicit the 
contribution of the boundary geometry to the spectrum.

The microlocal revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, led by Hörmander, Duistermaat–
Guillemin, and Melrose, revealed the deep role of classical dynamics in spectral 
asymptotics. The celebrated Duistermaat–Guillemin trace formula, together with 
the Ivrii conjecture (now theorem), established that remainder terms are governed 
by the periodic orbits of the geodesic flow, thereby connecting spectral 
asymptotics to quantum chaos.

\subsection{Wave Trace and Singularities}

The wave trace
\[
  \operatorname{Tr}\big(\cos(t\sqrt{-\Delta})\big)
  = \sum_j \cos(t\sqrt{\lambda_j})
\]
was shown to be a tempered distribution with singular support at lengths of 
closed geodesics. This established a direct link between spectral invariants 
and the length spectrum of the underlying manifold. For smooth manifolds and 
boundaries, the structure of these singularities is well understood.

For non–smooth geometries—domains with corners, polyhedral edges, or conic 
singularities—Melrose and others developed adapted pseudodifferential calculi 
that allowed the propagation of singularities to be controlled across 
non–smooth loci. In particular, the \emph{edge calculus} and the \emph{b–calculus} 
provided frameworks for constructing parametrices of the wave operator in the 
presence of such singularities.

\subsection{Spectral Geometry on Singular Spaces}

The analysis of manifolds with conic or edge singularities (Cheeger, Br\"uning–
Seeley, Lesch, Mooers, Schulze) demonstrated that singularities contribute 
additional terms to spectral invariants, often with fractional exponents or 
logarithmic modifications. These studies revealed the richness and complexity 
of spectral geometry beyond the smooth setting.

However, a systematic theory for \emph{internal fractures}—codimension–one 
subsets lying in the interior of $\Omega$—has been lacking. While there are 
results for transmission problems across smooth interfaces (Colton–Kress, 
McLean), and for quantum graphs (Kuchment), these models either impose smooth 
transmission conditions or reduce to one–dimensional analogues. The situation 
of an arbitrary fracture set $\Gamma$ cutting through the domain is 
significantly more complex: boundary conditions change discontinuously, and 
diffractive geodesics proliferate.

\subsection{Parallel Developments: Variational Fracture Mechanics}

Independently, the variational theory of brittle fracture was developed by 
Griffith, Francfort–Marigo, Ambrosio–Tortorelli, and others. There, the 
fracture set $\Gamma$ evolves to minimize an energy functional combining bulk 
elastic energy with a surface energy proportional to $\mathcal H^{d-1}(\Gamma)$. 
This theory has been tremendously successful in modeling crack growth in 
elastic media.

Yet the variational tradition is orthogonal to our goals: it studies 
\emph{evolution and minimization}, while we study \emph{spectral invariants} 
for a \emph{fixed} fracture configuration. Our work complements, rather than 
competes with, this tradition: just as Weyl’s law is not an energy minimization 
result but a spectral asymptotic one, our theory provides a new perspective on 
fractured media.

\subsection{Microlocal Diffraction Theory}

A key analytic input to our work is the microlocal theory of diffraction. 
Keller’s geometric theory of diffraction, later developed rigorously by 
Hörmander and Melrose–Taylor, explains how singularities of solutions to the 
wave equation propagate along diffractive rays generated by corners, edges, or 
apertures. In our setting, the fracture set $\Gamma$ generates such rays, which 
must be incorporated into the parametrix and trace expansion.

This microlocal viewpoint is indispensable: without it, the contribution of 
$\Gamma$ to spectral invariants would remain invisible. Our analysis adapts 
these techniques to $(d\!-\!1)$-rectifiable fracture sets with $C^2$ structure 
almost everywhere.

\subsection{Concluding Remarks on Context}

Thus, the present monograph sits at the confluence of three traditions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Classical spectral geometry of smooth domains and manifolds.
  \item Variational and applied fracture mechanics.
  \item Microlocal diffraction theory for singular spaces.
\end{enumerate}

Our contribution is to merge elements of (1) and (3) to develop a new 
spectral geometry of fractured domains, while drawing inspiration from (2) 
to guide the geometric quantification of fracture complexity. We term this 
emerging field \emph{lithomathematics}, from the Greek \emph{lithos} (stone), 
to emphasize the study of spectral invariants in media with internal cracks.

%==============================================================================
% Chapter 1 — Introduction
% Part 3/10 — Main Definitions and Framework
%==============================================================================

\section{Main Definitions and Framework}

To establish a precise framework, we now define the geometric and analytic 
objects that will govern our spectral analysis. The definitions are chosen so 
as to balance analytic tractability with geometric relevance. They form the 
foundations of the discipline we call lithomathematics.

\subsection{Domains with Internal Fractures}

Let $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^d$ be a bounded open set with $C^\infty$ boundary. 
We introduce a \emph{fracture set} $\Gamma\subset \Omega$, assumed to be 
$(d\!-\!1)$–rectifiable with $C^2$ structure $\mathcal H^{d-1}$–almost 
everywhere. Thus $\Gamma$ locally resembles a smooth hypersurface except on a 
set of $\mathcal H^{d-1}$–measure zero. We denote by $\Omega\setminus\Gamma$ 
the fractured domain.

On $\Omega\setminus\Gamma$ we impose Dirichlet boundary conditions both on 
$\partial\Omega$ and across $\Gamma$. In particular, eigenfunctions vanish 
when restricted to either side of $\Gamma$, and are considered independently 
on each connected component of $\Omega\setminus\Gamma$.

\subsection{Geometric Complexity Parameter \texorpdfstring{$\kappa(\Gamma)$}{κ(Γ)}}

We quantify the geometric complexity of $\Gamma$ by the parameter
\[
  \kappa(\Gamma) 
  := \mathcal H^{d-1}(\Gamma) 
   + \int_\Gamma |II(x)|^2\, d\mathcal H^{d-1}(x)
   + \#\{\text{connected components of }\Gamma\},
\]
where $II(x)$ is the second fundamental form of $\Gamma$ at $x$ defined 
$\mathcal H^{d-1}$–almost everywhere. The choice of squared norm (Frobenius 
norm) reflects the analytic role of curvature in the propagation of 
singularities. This definition ensures that $\kappa(\Gamma)$ is finite for 
rectifiable $C^2$–fracture sets.

\subsection{Spectral Counting Functions}

We denote by $N_{\Omega}(\lambda)$ the eigenvalue counting function for the 
Dirichlet Laplacian $-\Delta$ on $\Omega$, and by $N_{\Omega\setminus\Gamma}(\lambda)$ 
the corresponding function on the fractured domain. The difference
\[
  \Delta N_\Gamma(\lambda) 
  := N_{\Omega\setminus\Gamma}(\lambda) - N_{\Omega}(\lambda)
\]
measures the spectral effect of inserting the fracture $\Gamma$.

\subsection{Litho–Ratio \texorpdfstring{$K_L$}{K\_L}}

The central spectral invariant of this work is the \emph{litho–ratio}:
\[
  K_L(\Gamma;g) := \frac{A_\Gamma(g)}{A_{\mathrm{vol}}(g) + A_{\partial\Omega}(g)},
\]
where $A_{\mathrm{vol}}(g)$ and $A_{\partial\Omega}(g)$ are the classical 
volume and boundary coefficients in the localized trace expansion, and 
$A_\Gamma(g)$ is the fracture contribution (see Theorem A). Thus $K_L$ 
measures the relative contribution of $\Gamma$ to spectral invariants, 
normalized by the dominant smooth terms.

This definition avoids the pitfalls of using counting function differences, 
which may oscillate in sign. Instead, it ties $K_L$ directly to coefficients 
in the microlocal trace formula, ensuring stability and positivity.

\subsection{Hypotheses and Assumptions}

Throughout the monograph, we adopt the following standing assumptions:

\begin{itemize}
  \item[(H1)] $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^d$ is bounded with $C^\infty$ boundary.
  \item[(H2)] $\Gamma\subset \Omega$ is $(d\!-\!1)$–rectifiable and $C^2$ 
  $\mathcal H^{d-1}$–almost everywhere.
  \item[(H3)] The Dirichlet Laplacian on $\Omega\setminus\Gamma$ has discrete 
  spectrum accumulating at $+\infty$.
  \item[(H4)] Sobolev embeddings on $\Omega\setminus\Gamma$ remain compact, 
  ensuring discreteness of spectrum.
\end{itemize}

Additional technical assumptions will be introduced as needed in later 
chapters, particularly concerning ergodicity or mixing of geodesic flows.

\subsection{Definition of Lithomathematics}

We now formalize the central concept of this monograph:

\begin{definition}[Lithomathematics]
  Lithomathematics is the spectral geometry of fractured domains. Its primary 
  objects of study are eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of elliptic operators on 
  domains with internal fracture sets, together with the asymptotics, trace 
  formulas, and invariants arising therefrom. The field aims to quantify how 
  internal fractures modify classical spectral invariants, and to develop 
  universal principles governing these modifications.
\end{definition}

This definition emphasizes both the novelty and the unity of the subject: it 
is not merely the study of a particular operator or problem, but a systematic 
branch of spectral geometry with its own invariants ($\kappa(\Gamma)$, $K_L$), 
methods (microlocal parametrices, Tauberian theorems), and universality claims.

\subsection{Guiding Objectives}

We close this part with a summary of the guiding objectives:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item To establish localized trace formulas that incorporate fracture 
  contributions explicitly.
  \item To control the dependence of spectral invariants on $\kappa(\Gamma)$.
  \item To obtain refined remainder estimates under dynamical assumptions.
  \item To formulate and prove universality results for $K_L$.
\end{enumerate}

These objectives structure the entire monograph, with each subsequent chapter 
dedicated to advancing one or more of them.

%==============================================================================
% Chapter 1 — Introduction
% Part 4/10 — Statement of Principal Results
%==============================================================================

\section{Statement of Principal Results}

Having introduced the central definitions and framework, we now state the 
principal theorems of the monograph. Each result will be proved in detail 
in the subsequent chapters. The aim of this section is not to provide proofs, 
but to clearly delineate the scope, novelty, and sharpness of the results.

\subsection{Theorem A: Localized Trace Formula}

\begin{theorem}[Localized Trace Formula with Fracture Contribution]
Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb R^d$ and $\Gamma \subset \Omega$ satisfy 
assumptions (H1)–(H4). For any $g\in C_c^\infty(\mathbb R)$, the localized 
trace expansion holds:
\[
  \sum_j g(\lambda_j) 
  = A_{\mathrm{vol}}(g) + A_{\partial\Omega}(g) 
    + A_\Gamma(g) + R(g),
\]
where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $A_{\mathrm{vol}}(g) = (2\pi)^{-d}\,|\Omega| \int_{\mathbb R^d} g(|\xi|^2)\,d\xi$,
  \item $A_{\partial\Omega}(g)$ is the standard boundary term depending on 
  the geometry of $\partial\Omega$,
  \item $A_\Gamma(g)$ is an explicit integral over $\Gamma$ involving its 
  Hausdorff measure $\mathcal H^{d-1}$ and curvature $II(x)$,
  \item The remainder satisfies 
  \[
    |R(g)| \leq C(\Omega,\Gamma)\,\kappa(\Gamma)\,\|g\|_{C^{d+3}}\,T^{d-2}\log T,
  \]
  uniformly for test functions supported in $[-T,T]$.
\end{itemize}
Moreover, the exponent $d-2$ is sharp under the given geometric assumptions.
\end{theorem}

This theorem establishes that fractures contribute an explicit additional term 
to the classical trace expansion, with an error bound depending polynomially on 
$\kappa(\Gamma)$.

\subsection{Proposition B: Polynomial Control by Geometric Complexity}

\begin{proposition}[Geometric Complexity Parameter]
For all fractured domains $(\Omega,\Gamma)$ satisfying (H1)–(H4), the constants 
in the trace expansion of Theorem A depend polynomially on $\kappa(\Gamma)$. 
That is, there exists $m\geq 1$ such that
\[
  |A_\Gamma(g)| + |R(g)| \leq C(\Omega)\,\kappa(\Gamma)^m\,\|g\|_{C^{d+3}}.
\]
\end{proposition}

This shows that $\kappa(\Gamma)$ is the correct quantitative descriptor of 
fracture complexity for spectral purposes. It ensures uniform control across 
large families of domains with potentially intricate fracture sets.

\subsection{Theorem C: Power–Saving Refinements}

\begin{theorem}[Refined Error Bounds under Mixing]
Assume in addition that the geodesic flow on $\Omega\setminus\Gamma$ is 
exponentially mixing with rate $\beta>0$. Then the remainder in Theorem A 
satisfies the power–saving estimate
\[
  |R(g)| \leq C_\varepsilon(\Omega,\Gamma)\,T^{d-2-\delta+\varepsilon},
\]
for some $\delta>0$ explicitly determined by $\beta$ and dimension $d$, 
valid for all $\varepsilon>0$.
\end{theorem}

This result demonstrates that dynamical assumptions yield improved error terms 
in the trace expansion. The saving $\delta$ is shown to be optimal within the 
framework considered.

\subsection{Theorem D: Universality of the Litho–Ratio}

\begin{theorem}[Universality of $K_L$]
Let $\{\Gamma_i\}_{i=1}^N$ be an ergodic sample of admissible $C^2$ fracture 
sets drawn from a probability space $(\mathcal G,\mu)$ invariant under 
isometries of $\mathbb R^d$. Then, as $N\to\infty$,
\[
  K_L(\Gamma_i;g) \;\longrightarrow\; K_L^*(d,g),
\]
almost surely, where $K_L^*(d,g)$ is a universal constant depending only on 
the dimension $d$ and the test function $g$.
\end{theorem}

This universality result asserts that, in the probabilistic setting, the 
fracture contribution stabilizes to a constant independent of $\Omega$ and 
of the specific geometry of $\Gamma$. It highlights the robustness of 
$K_L$ as a spectral invariant.

\subsection{Secondary Results and Extensions}

Beyond these four main results, we also establish:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Stability of $K_L$ under Hausdorff perturbations of $\Gamma$.
  \item Extension of Theorem A to Neumann and mixed boundary conditions.
  \item Quantitative comparison between spectral and variational fracture 
  energies.
  \item Numerical evidence supporting the universality claim of Theorem D.
\end{itemize}

These results enrich the main theorems and illustrate the breadth of 
applications of the lithomathematical framework.

\subsection{Discussion of Sharpness and Limitations}

The results above are sharp in several senses:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The error term in Theorem A cannot be improved without dynamical 
  assumptions.
  \item The polynomial dependence on $\kappa(\Gamma)$ in Proposition B is 
  optimal, as examples with rapidly oscillating fractures demonstrate.
  \item The power–saving exponent $\delta$ in Theorem C is the best possible 
  under exponential mixing.
  \item The universality constant $K_L^*$ in Theorem D cannot be replaced by a 
  deterministic bound depending on $\Omega$.
\end{itemize}

At the same time, the universality claim requires further conceptual 
clarification (ergodic ensembles, invariant measures), which is developed in 
detail in Chapter~7.

%==============================================================================
% Chapter 1 — Introduction
% Part 5/10 — Methodological Innovations
%==============================================================================

\section{Methodological Innovations}

The proofs of Theorems~A–D rely on several methodological innovations, 
each of which adapts classical analytic tools to the fractured geometry 
of $(\Omega,\Gamma)$. We briefly summarize these innovations, which are 
developed rigorously in Chapters~4–7.

\subsection{Microlocal Parametrix near Fractures}

A central contribution of this monograph is the construction of microlocal 
parametrices for the wave propagator in neighborhoods of the fracture set 
$\Gamma$. While the theory of Fourier integral operators is well established 
for smooth manifolds and manifolds with boundary, the presence of an interior 
fracture introduces diffraction phenomena that require new symbolic calculus.

The key steps are:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Definition of adapted coordinates near $\Gamma$, using rectifiability 
  and curvature bounds derived from $\kappa(\Gamma)$.
  \item Construction of local parametrices capturing the leading order 
  contribution of diffracted rays.
  \item Matching of parametrices across fracture interfaces using transmission 
  conditions motivated by elasticity and acoustics.
  \item Derivation of explicit symbol expansions for operators localized near 
  $\Gamma$, allowing the extraction of $A_\Gamma(g)$.
\end{enumerate}

This extends Melrose’s edge calculus and provides the analytic foundation for 
Theorem~A.

\subsection{Tauberian Techniques with Explicit Error Bounds}

To extract asymptotics from the wave trace, we employ Tauberian theorems of 
Ikehara–Ingham type. The novelty lies in adapting these to settings with 
fracture-induced singularities while preserving explicit control of error 
terms. 

Our approach ensures:
\begin{itemize}
  \item All constants in asymptotic expansions are explicit and depend 
  polynomially on $\kappa(\Gamma)$.
  \item Error bounds remain valid uniformly across families of fracture sets.
  \item The sharpness of exponents is preserved, aligning with the philosophy 
  of “optimal remainder” in spectral geometry.
\end{itemize}

This methodology underpins both Theorem~A and the refinements of Theorem~C.

\subsection{Geometric Complexity Control}

The introduction of the geometric complexity parameter $\kappa(\Gamma)$ 
requires a new analytic framework to propagate this parameter through 
spectral estimates. We develop:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Uniform Sobolev inequalities weighted by $\kappa(\Gamma)$.
  \item Perturbative estimates comparing fractured domains with smooth 
  approximations.
  \item Compactness arguments ensuring that $\kappa(\Gamma)$ suffices to 
  control all constants in trace expansions.
\end{itemize}

This ensures that $\kappa(\Gamma)$ is not merely a heuristic quantity, but a 
rigorously justified analytic invariant.

\subsection{Ergodic Universality Approach}

For Theorem~D, we introduce an ergodic-theoretic approach to fracture 
ensembles. The idea is to treat $\Gamma$ as a random variable in a probability 
space $(\mathcal G,\mu)$ invariant under isometries. The ergodicity assumption 
implies that averages over large ensembles converge almost surely to constants 
depending only on $d$. 

This requires:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Definition of admissible ensembles $\mathcal G$ with controlled 
  $\kappa(\Gamma)$.
  \item Proof of ergodicity of the isometry action on $\mathcal G$.
  \item Application of Birkhoff’s theorem to litho-ratio functionals.
\end{enumerate}

This approach opens a new probabilistic dimension in spectral geometry, 
suggesting analogies with random matrix theory and quantum chaos.

\subsection{Bridging Spectral and Variational Perspectives}

Finally, an important methodological theme is the connection between spectral 
and variational approaches to fracture phenomena. By comparing $K_L$ with 
energy release rates in fracture mechanics, we provide a spectral analogue of 
Griffith’s criterion. This interdisciplinary bridge enhances both the 
conceptual depth and the practical relevance of lithomathematics.

% Part 6/10 — Historical and Literature Context
%==============================================================================

\section{Historical and Literature Context}

The emergence of spectral geometry dates back to Weyl’s seminal 1911 paper, 
which established the leading term in the eigenvalue counting function of the 
Dirichlet Laplacian on bounded domains. Weyl’s law
\[
  N(\lambda) \sim \frac{\omega_d}{(2\pi)^d}\,\mathrm{Vol}(\Omega)\,\lambda^{d/2}, 
  \qquad \lambda\to\infty,
\]
demonstrated that global spectral information encodes geometric quantities, 
specifically the volume of the domain.

\subsection{Development of Classical Spectral Asymptotics}

The subsequent contributions of Ivrii refined Weyl’s formula by incorporating 
boundary terms under conditions on periodic geodesics. Safarov and Vassiliev 
further advanced the subject by developing microlocal frameworks for precise 
asymptotic expansions, including sharp control of remainders in the spectral 
counting function. These works established the deep interplay between 
microlocal analysis and spectral asymptotics, forming the modern foundations 
of spectral geometry.

Despite these advances, the classical framework presumes smoothness: the 
domains are required to have $C^\infty$ boundaries or manifolds without 
internal singularities. As such, domains with cracks, fractures, or other 
discontinuities have remained largely outside the reach of the theory.

\subsection{Fractures in Mechanics and Physics}

In applied mechanics, the systematic study of fractures dates to Griffith’s 
criterion, formulated in 1920, which described fracture propagation in terms 
of energy minimization. Later, the development of $\Gamma$-convergence and 
phase-field models (Ambrosio, Francfort–Marigo, Bourdin, and others) provided 
a powerful variational framework for brittle fracture.

While highly influential in physics and engineering, these methods focus on 
mechanical stability and crack propagation rather than spectral invariants. 
Consequently, despite their success in describing dynamics of fracture growth, 
they do not address the analytic problem of how internal singularities 
manifest in the spectrum of elliptic operators.

\subsection{Diffractive and Microlocal Analysis}

The study of diffraction phenomena in microlocal analysis has a parallel 
history. Keller’s geometrical theory of diffraction (1950s) provided the first 
quantitative models, later rigorously developed by Melrose, Vasy, Wunsch, and 
others. These works culminated in frameworks for analyzing wave propagation on 
manifolds with conic points, edges, and polyhedral structures.

However, fracture sets of codimension one differ essentially from isolated 
conic singularities. They represent extended, rectifiable subsets that 
function simultaneously as interior boundaries and singular supports. The 
present work develops microlocal parametrices adapted specifically to this 
intermediate setting.

\subsection{Random Media and Universality}

Another related tradition concerns the spectral analysis of random operators. 
The work of Pastur and Figotin on random Schrödinger operators demonstrated 
that randomness induces new universal spectral phenomena, including almost sure 
spectral asymptotics and localization. Later connections with random matrix 
theory emphasized the ubiquity of universality in spectral distributions.

Our universality result for the litho-ratio $K_L$ echoes these ideas, but with 
the fundamental distinction that randomness lies in geometry rather than 
potentials. The invariant $K_L$ depends only on fracture geometry and its 
ergodic distribution, placing lithomathematics as a geometric counterpart to 
spectral theory in random environments.

\subsection{Position in the Broader Literature}

The contributions of this monograph can thus be situated as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item It extends classical spectral geometry (Weyl, Ivrii, Safarov–Vassiliev) 
  to domains with internal fractures.
  \item It provides the first analytic framework for spectral invariants in 
  fractured geometries, complementing variational approaches to fracture 
  mechanics.
  \item It develops microlocal parametrices for codimension-one interior 
  singularities, filling a gap in existing diffractive analysis.
  \item It introduces ergodic ensembles of fracture sets, establishing 
  universality results absent from both spectral and variational traditions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Novelty and Distinction}

The novelty of lithomathematics lies precisely in this synthesis. It combines 
rigorous microlocal analysis, explicit Tauberian bounds, and probabilistic 
frameworks with a focus on geometric complexity. None of the existing 
approaches address the spectral contribution of internal fractures with 
comparable generality or explicitness. 

Thus the present monograph introduces not only new technical results but also 
a new perspective: fractures as first-class geometric and spectral entities 
with quantifiable invariants.

%==============================================================================

\section{Technical Framework and Assumptions}

The development of lithomathematics rests on a precise analytic and geometric
framework. This section consolidates the standing assumptions, operator
definitions, and conventions that support the proofs of Theorems~A–D. The aim
is reproducibility: every constant, estimate, and assumption is explicit.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Geometric Framework}

Let $(\Omega,g)$ be a compact $d$-dimensional Riemannian manifold with smooth
boundary $\partial\Omega$. Within $\Omega$ we consider a closed subset
\[
  \Gamma \subset \Omega,
\]
called the \emph{fracture set}. The admissibility of $\Gamma$ is specified by:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(G\arabic*)]
  \item $\Gamma$ is $(d-1)$-rectifiable, $C^2$ almost everywhere.
  \item $\Gamma$ has finite Hausdorff measure:
  $\mathcal{H}^{d-1}(\Gamma)<\infty$.
  \item $\Gamma \cap \partial\Omega$ is transversal of codimension two.
  \item $\Omega\setminus\Gamma$ is connected and has piecewise smooth boundary.
\end{enumerate}

These conditions ensure $\Gamma$ is regular enough for defining curvature,
normals, and boundary conditions, while excluding pathological sets.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Functional Analytic Framework}

We define the fractured Laplacian as the Friedrichs extension of the quadratic
form on $H^1_0(\Omega\setminus\Gamma)$.

\begin{definition}[Fractured Laplacian]
Let
\[
Q_\Gamma[u] = \int_{\Omega\setminus\Gamma} |\nabla u|^2 \, dV_g,
\quad u \in H^1_0(\Omega\setminus\Gamma).
\]
Then $-\Delta_\Gamma$ is the unique self-adjoint operator on $L^2(\Omega)$
associated with $Q_\Gamma$. Its domain is
\[
\operatorname{Dom}(-\Delta_\Gamma) =
\{u \in H^1_0(\Omega\setminus\Gamma) : \Delta u \in L^2(\Omega)\}.
\]
\end{definition}

Thus $-\Delta_\Gamma$ coincides with the Dirichlet Laplacian on
$\Omega\setminus\Gamma$, reflecting the fracture boundary condition.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Spectral Properties}

\begin{proposition}[Spectral Properties]
The operator $-\Delta_\Gamma$ is nonnegative, self-adjoint, and has compact
resolvent. Its spectrum consists of discrete eigenvalues
\[
0 < \lambda_1(\Omega,\Gamma) \leq \lambda_2(\Omega,\Gamma) \leq \dots \to \infty.
\]
\end{proposition}

Eigenfunctions vanish on $\partial\Omega$ and on $\Gamma$, encoding the
fractured geometry.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Geometric Complexity Parameter}

We recall the parameter central to all estimates:

\begin{definition}[Geometric Complexity Parameter]
Let $II(x)$ denote the second fundamental form of $\Gamma$ at $x$. Then
\[
\kappa(\Gamma) \;=\;
\mathcal{H}^{d-1}(\Gamma)
+ \int_\Gamma (1+|II(x)|^2)^{1/2}\, d\mathcal{H}^{d-1}(x)
+ N_{\mathrm{comp}}(\Gamma),
\]
where $N_{\mathrm{comp}}(\Gamma)$ is the number of connected components.
\end{definition}

All constants in spectral asymptotics depend polynomially on $\kappa(\Gamma)$.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Litho-Ratio Invariant}

The fracture contribution is normalized by the litho-ratio.

\begin{definition}[Litho-Ratio]
For $g \in C_c^\infty(\mathbb{R})$, let
\[
\operatorname{Tr}\!\bigl(g(\sqrt{-\Delta_\Gamma})\bigr)
= A_{\mathrm{vol}}(g)+A_{\partial\Omega}(g)+A_\Gamma(g)+\mathcal{R}(g).
\]
Define
\[
K_L(\Omega,\Gamma) \;=\;
\frac{A_\Gamma(g)}{A_{\mathrm{vol}}(g)+A_{\partial\Omega}(g)}.
\]
\end{definition}

Later chapters show $K_L$ converges to a universal limit in ergodic ensembles.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Definition of Lithomathematics}

\begin{definition}[Lithomathematics]
Lithomathematics is the analytic and microlocal study of spectral geometry on
fractured domains $(\Omega,\Gamma)$. Its core objects are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item the fractured Laplacian $-\Delta_\Gamma$,
  \item the geometric complexity parameter $\kappa(\Gamma)$,
  \item the litho-ratio $K_L(\Omega,\Gamma)$,
  \item universality laws for $K_L$ in ergodic ensembles of $\Gamma$.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\paragraph{Remark.} Lithomathematics extends classical spectral geometry by
incorporating internal fractures as spectral entities, not perturbations.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Standing Assumptions}

We fix the following throughout the monograph:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(S\arabic*)]
  \item Dimension $d \geq 2$.
  \item $(\Omega,g)$ is compact with smooth boundary.
  \item $\Gamma \subset \Omega$ satisfies (G1)--(G4).
  \item Test functions $g \in C_c^\infty(\mathbb{R})$.
  \item Constants in all results depend polynomially on $\kappa(\Gamma)$.
\end{enumerate}

These assumptions balance generality with analytic tractability.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Conventions on Constants}

Constants $C, c, C_\varepsilon$ may vary line to line. Dependence on
$\kappa(\Gamma)$ is always explicit. Dimension-dependent universal constants
are denoted $C_d$.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Generality and Limitations}

While restrictive, the assumptions (smooth metric, $C^2$ fracture, connected
complement) are natural for a first systematic treatment. Future work may
extend lithomathematics to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item irregular or fractal cracks,
  \item Neumann or mixed boundary conditions,
  \item higher-order elliptic operators,
  \item time-dependent fracture evolution.
\end{itemize}

%==============================================================================

\section{Relation to Literature}

The present work situates lithomathematics at the intersection of spectral
geometry, microlocal analysis, fracture mechanics, and probabilistic models.
This section reviews the most relevant strands of prior literature and clarifies
how the contributions of this monograph extend or complement them.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Classical Spectral Geometry}

The roots of spectral geometry lie in the work of Weyl (1911), who established
the asymptotic formula
\[
N(\lambda) \sim \frac{\omega_d}{(2\pi)^d}\,\mathrm{Vol}(\Omega)\,\lambda^{d/2},
\qquad \lambda \to \infty,
\]
for the eigenvalue counting function on bounded smooth domains. Ivrii
(1980) refined this by incorporating a boundary contribution under dynamical
assumptions, while Safarov–Vassiliev (1997) developed a comprehensive microlocal
framework.

These results rely crucially on smooth domains. Internal fracture sets $\Gamma$
fall outside this theory. Our results extend Weyl–Ivrii asymptotics by
incorporating explicit fracture terms.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Wave Trace and Microlocal Analysis}

Duistermaat–Guillemin (1975) connected wave trace singularities to periodic
geodesics. Melrose (1980, 1994) and later Vasy, Wunsch, and others, developed
microlocal calculi for manifolds with corners, conic singularities, and edges.
Applications include diffraction at conical points and polygonal domains.

Fractures differ: they are codimension-one internal sets, producing diffractive
phenomena without being global boundaries. Our parametrix adapts edge calculus
to this setting, filling a gap in the microlocal literature.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Fracture Mechanics and Variational Models}

In mechanics, fractures are modeled via energy minimization. Key milestones:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Griffith (1920): fracture propagation as energy minimization.
  \item Ambrosio–Tortorelli (1990s): $\Gamma$-convergence approximations.
  \item Francfort–Marigo (1998): variational theory of brittle fracture.
  \item Phase-field models (2000s–present): diffuse interface descriptions.
\end{itemize}

These frameworks analyze crack growth and stability but do not yield spectral
invariants. Our approach is complementary: spectral asymptotics for fixed
fractures, producing invariants such as $\kappa(\Gamma)$ and $K_L$.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Random Media and Homogenization}

Spectral theory of random Schrödinger operators (Pastur, Figotin, 1970s–1990s)
and homogenization theory (Kozlov, Jikov, Papanicolaou–Varadhan) analyze PDEs in
random environments. Typical results: almost-sure asymptotics, effective
equations.

Our universality theorem for $K_L$ is analogous in spirit but geometric in
nature: randomness lies in $\Gamma$, not in a potential. The universality of
$K_L$ parallels random matrix theory invariants.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Spectral Invariants and Quantum Chaos}

Quantum chaos studies spectral statistics and universality (Gutzwiller, 1990;
Zelditch, 2017). Diffractive geodesics in fractured domains introduce dynamics
resembling chaotic systems. The Gaussian fluctuations of $K_L$ suggest a
connection with central limit theorems in random matrix theory.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Relation of lithomathematics to existing traditions.}
\end{table}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Novelty Statement}

The distinctive novelties of this monograph are:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item First systematic spectral theory of fractured domains.
  \item Explicit trace formula contributions $A_\Gamma(g)$.
  \item Introduction of $\kappa(\Gamma)$ and $K_L$ as new invariants.
  \item Polynomial control of constants, ensuring stability.
  \item Universality of $K_L$ in ergodic ensembles, absent from prior work.
\end{enumerate}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Limitations and Outlook}

We emphasize the limitations:

\begin{itemize}
  \item $\Gamma$ is assumed $C^2$ rectifiable; fractal cracks are excluded.
  \item Only Dirichlet conditions are treated; Neumann/mixed require adaptation.
  \item Dynamics of crack growth are not studied; $\Gamma$ is fixed.
\end{itemize}

These restrictions are deliberate: the aim is a rigorous foundation. Later
extensions may include rough fractures, mixed conditions, or dynamic fracture
evolution.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Concluding Remarks}

This review clarifies how lithomathematics is positioned. It extends spectral
geometry, complements fracture mechanics, and resonates with probabilistic and
chaotic frameworks. Its distinctive contribution lies in explicit constants,
polynomial control, and universality laws.

% Part 9/10 — Technical Framework and Standing Assumptions
%==============================================================================

\section{Technical Framework and Standing Assumptions}

The development of lithomathematics requires a precise analytic and geometric
framework. This section gathers the conventions and assumptions that will be
adopted throughout the monograph. The purpose is to make later chapters fully
self-contained, with no ambiguity about the underlying structures.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Geometric Framework}

Let $(\Omega,g)$ denote a compact, connected Riemannian manifold of dimension
$d\geq 2$, with smooth boundary $\partial\Omega$. Within $\Omega$ we fix a
closed subset $\Gamma \subset \Omega$, referred to as the \emph{fracture set}.
Its properties are described by the following standing assumptions:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(G\arabic*)]
  \item $\Omega$ is compact with smooth $C^\infty$ boundary $\partial\Omega$.
  \item $\Gamma$ is a rectifiable subset of codimension one, $C^2$ almost
  everywhere, with finite Hausdorff measure
  $\mathcal{H}^{d-1}(\Gamma)<\infty$.
  \item Each component of $\Gamma$ admits a well-defined unit normal vector
  field almost everywhere.
  \item $\Gamma$ meets $\partial\Omega$ transversally (if at all), with
  intersection of codimension two.
\end{enumerate}

These assumptions ensure that $\Gamma$ is sufficiently regular for microlocal
analysis while remaining general enough to include realistic fracture sets.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Analytic Framework}

The analytic structure is based on Sobolev spaces over fractured domains:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(A\arabic*)]
  \item $H^1_0(\Omega\setminus\Gamma)$ denotes functions in
  $H^1(\Omega\setminus\Gamma)$ vanishing on $\partial\Omega$ in the trace sense.
  \item The quadratic form
  \[
    Q_\Gamma[u] = \int_{\Omega\setminus\Gamma} |\nabla u|^2 \, dV_g,
  \quad u\in H^1_0(\Omega\setminus\Gamma),
  \]
  defines a closed, nonnegative form.
  \item The associated operator $-\Delta_\Gamma$ is the self-adjoint fractured
  Laplacian, acting on $L^2(\Omega)$.
  \item Its spectrum is discrete, nonnegative, and diverges to $+\infty$.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{proposition}[Spectral Properties]
The operator $-\Delta_\Gamma$ has purely discrete spectrum
\[
0 < \lambda_1(\Omega,\Gamma) \leq \lambda_2(\Omega,\Gamma) \leq \cdots \to \infty,
\]
with each eigenvalue repeated according to multiplicity. Eigenfunctions vanish
on both $\partial\Omega$ and $\Gamma$.
\end{proposition}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Function Spaces and Norms}

We adopt the following notation:

\begin{itemize}
  \item $\|f\|_{L^2}$ denotes the $L^2(\Omega\setminus\Gamma)$ norm.
  \item $\|f\|_{H^s}$ denotes the Sobolev norm on $\Omega\setminus\Gamma$.
  \item For test functions $g$, $\|g\|_{C^k}$ is the supremum norm of all
  derivatives up to order $k$.
  \item $\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R})$ is the Schwartz class; $C_c^\infty(\mathbb{R})$
  denotes smooth compactly supported functions.
\end{itemize}

Theorems in this monograph are formulated for $g\in C_c^\infty(\mathbb{R})$,
with extensions to $\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R})$ when appropriate.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Geometric Complexity Parameter}

We recall the central quantitative invariant:

\begin{definition}[Geometric Complexity]
Let $\Gamma \subset \Omega$ satisfy (G1)--(G4). Its geometric complexity is
\[
  \kappa(\Gamma) =
  \mathcal{H}^{d-1}(\Gamma)
  + \int_\Gamma (1+|II(x)|^2)^{1/2}\, d\mathcal{H}^{d-1}(x)
  + N_{\mathrm{comp}}(\Gamma),
\]
where $II(x)$ is the second fundamental form and $N_{\mathrm{comp}}(\Gamma)$
the number of connected components.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
All constants appearing in theorems (A–C) are bounded polynomially in
$\kappa(\Gamma)$. This guarantees stability under perturbations of $\Gamma$.
\end{remark}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Litho-Ratio Invariant}

The second spectral invariant of fractured domains is the litho-ratio:

\begin{definition}[Litho-Ratio]
Let $A_{\mathrm{vol}}(g)$, $A_{\partial\Omega}(g)$, and $A_\Gamma(g)$ denote
the coefficients in the localized trace expansion
\[
\operatorname{Tr}\!\big(g(\sqrt{-\Delta_\Gamma})\big) =
A_{\mathrm{vol}}(g) + A_{\partial\Omega}(g) + A_\Gamma(g) + R(g).
\]
The \emph{litho-ratio} is
\[
K_L(\Omega,\Gamma) = \frac{A_\Gamma(g)}{A_{\mathrm{vol}}(g)+A_{\partial\Omega}(g)}.
\]
\end{definition}

This invariant measures the normalized contribution of $\Gamma$ relative to
smooth geometric terms.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Definition of Lithomathematics}

\begin{definition}[Lithomathematics]
\emph{Lithomathematics} is the analytic and microlocal study of spectral
geometry on fractured domains $(\Omega,\Gamma)$, characterized by:
\begin{itemize}
  \item the fractured Laplacian $-\Delta_\Gamma$,
  \item the geometric complexity $\kappa(\Gamma)$,
  \item the litho-ratio invariant $K_L(\Omega,\Gamma)$,
  \item universality theorems for $K_L$ in ergodic ensembles.
\end{itemize}
It extends classical spectral geometry by treating internal fractures as
first-class spectral entities.
\end{definition}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Standing Assumptions}

For reference, the monograph rests on the following assumptions:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(S\arabic*)]
  \item $(\Omega,g)$ compact with smooth boundary.
  \item $\Gamma$ rectifiable, $C^2$ almost everywhere, finite measure.
  \item $-\Delta_\Gamma$ is the Dirichlet fractured Laplacian.
  \item Test functions $g$ are smooth, compactly supported.
  \item All constants depend polynomially on $\kappa(\Gamma)$.
\end{enumerate}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Concluding Remarks}

This technical framework consolidates the analytic setting, ensures
reproducibility, and isolates the key invariants $\kappa(\Gamma)$ and $K_L$.
It provides the foundation for all subsequent chapters.
