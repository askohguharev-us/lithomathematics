%==============================================================================

\subsection{Orientation}

The guiding question of spectral geometry is to what extent 
the eigenvalues of natural differential operators encode the 
geometric and analytic structure of the underlying space. 
This monograph addresses this question for domains containing 
internal fracture sets, thereby extending the century-long 
trajectory of spectral theory into a class of singular geometries 
not previously covered by rigorous asymptotic analysis.

\subsection{From Weyl’s Law to Modern Microlocal Analysis}

The field originates with Hermann Weyl’s 1911 discovery 
\cite{Weyl1911} that the counting function $N(\lambda)$ of the 
Dirichlet Laplacian on a bounded Euclidean domain satisfies
\[
  N(\lambda) \sim \frac{\omega_d}{(2\pi)^d} \, \mathrm{Vol}(\Omega) \, \lambda^{d/2},
  \qquad \lambda \to \infty,
\]
where $\omega_d$ denotes the volume of the unit ball in $\R^d$. 
This relation --- the first \emph{spectral asymptotic law} --- 
demonstrated that spectral data encodes volume. 
It established a paradigm: spectral coefficients correspond 
to geometric invariants.

Over the following decades, refinements revealed boundary 
contributions. Ivrii’s work in the 1980s \cite{Ivrii1980} 
proved the two-term Weyl law for smooth domains, showing that 
\[
  N(\lambda) = \frac{\omega_d}{(2\pi)^d} \, \mathrm{Vol}(\Omega) \, \lambda^{d/2}
    - \frac{\omega_{d-1}}{4(2\pi)^{d-1}} \, \mathrm{Area}(\partial\Omega) \, \lambda^{(d-1)/2}
    + o(\lambda^{(d-1)/2}),
\]
and identified precise conditions under which periodic billiards 
do or do not contribute to the remainder. 
Thus, geometry of the boundary --- not just volume --- entered 
the spectral dictionary.

Parallel advances tackled non-smooth settings. 
Melrose \cite{Melrose1979} analyzed polyhedral corners, developing 
a microlocal theory of diffraction that accounted for singular 
contributions to the wave trace. 
Safarov and Vassiliev’s monograph \cite{SafarovVassiliev1997} 
codified a general framework for spectral asymptotics, 
emphasizing sharp remainder estimates and microlocal control 
for domains with piecewise smooth boundaries.

At the same time, microlocal analysis reshaped the entire subject. 
Hörmander’s four-volume treatise \cite{Hormander1990} provided the 
analytic foundation, while Duistermaat--Guillemin 
\cite{DuistermaatGuillemin1975} showed that singularities of the 
wave trace correspond to closed geodesics. 
This crystallized the \emph{dynamical dictionary}: 
spectral invariants are shadows of the geodesic flow.

\subsection{Present Limitations}

By the end of the twentieth century, the field possessed 
a mature arsenal: heat and wave kernel parametrices, Tauberian 
theorems, microlocal calculus, boundary layer methods, and 
diffractive corrections. 
With these tools, one could analyze smooth domains, manifolds 
with boundary, polyhedral corners, and even some stratified spaces.

Yet a crucial class of geometries remained outside reach: 
domains containing internal fracture sets, i.e.\ compact 
codimension-one subsets across which the medium may be 
discontinuous. 
Neither classical variational approaches (e.g.\ in fracture 
mechanics via Griffith energy) nor microlocal methods had yet 
produced a trace formula or asymptotic expansion incorporating 
such internal sets. 
In particular, no general framework existed for quantifying how 
a fracture modifies spectral invariants --- volume terms, boundary 
terms, curvature corrections --- or for formulating a coherent 
geometric parameter controlling these effects.

\subsection{The Gap Addressed Here}

The present monograph addresses precisely this lacuna. 
It introduces a framework we call \emph{lithomathematics}, 
designed to extend spectral asymptotics and variational 
principles to fractured domains. 
We show that one can construct localized trace formulas, 
define a geometric complexity parameter $\kappa(\Gamma)$, 
and establish universal invariants such as the litho-ratio $K_L$, 
thus completing a natural extension of the spectral dictionary 
from smooth and piecewise smooth settings to domains with 
internal fractures.

\section{Objectives and Contributions}
\label{sec:intro-objectives}
%==============================================================================

\subsection{Objectives}

The central objectives of this monograph are fourfold:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{O\arabic*}]
    \item \textbf{Extension of Spectral Asymptotics.}
    Establish a localized trace formula valid for domains $(\Omega,g)$
    containing internal fracture sets $\Gamma$, thereby extending the
    Weyl--Ivrii--Safarov--Vassiliev theory to singular geometries.

    \item \textbf{Quantification of Fracture Complexity.}
    Define a geometric parameter $\kappa(\Gamma)$ that controls the
    contribution of fractures to spectral invariants, ensuring explicit
    dependence of all constants on $\kappa(\Gamma)$.

    \item \textbf{Refined Asymptotics under Dynamical Hypotheses.}
    Derive power-saving error bounds in the trace formula under
    exponential mixing assumptions for the geodesic flow, with optimal
    exponents depending on dynamical parameters.

    \item \textbf{Universal Invariants and Ergodic Limits.}
    Introduce the litho-ratio $K_L$, a spectral invariant measuring the
    relative fracture contribution, and prove that it admits a universal
    ergodic limit $K_L^*$ under random sampling of admissible fractures.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Contributions}

The main contributions, formulated as rigorous statements, are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Theorem A (Localized Trace Formula).} 
    For compact Riemannian manifolds $(\Omega,g)$ with fracture set
    $\Gamma \subset \Omega$, the trace of the Dirichlet Laplacian admits
    a decomposition
    \[
      \operatorname{Tr}(g(\sqrt{-\Delta})) \;=\;
        A_{\mathrm{vol}}(g) + A_{\partial\Omega}(g) + A_{\Gamma}(g) + \mathcal{R}(g),
    \]
    where $A_{\Gamma}(g)$ is an explicit integral over $\Gamma$, and the
    remainder satisfies
    \[
      |\mathcal{R}(g)| \leq C(\Omega,\Gamma)\,\kappa(\Gamma)\,\|g\|_{C^{d+3}} \,
          T^{d-2}\log(1+T).
    \]

    \item \textbf{Definition (Geometric Complexity Parameter).}
    The parameter $\kappa(\Gamma)$ is defined by
    \[
    \kappa(\Gamma) \;=\;
      \mathcal{H}^{d-1}(\Gamma) +
      \int_\Gamma (1+|II(x)|^2)^{1/2} \, d\mathcal{H}^{d-1}(x) +
      N_{\text{comp}}(\Gamma).
    \]
    All constants in the spectral expansions are polynomially bounded in
    $\kappa(\Gamma)$.

    \item \textbf{Theorem B (Power-Saving Refinements).}
    If the geodesic flow on $(\Omega \setminus \Gamma,g)$ is
    exponentially mixing with rate $\beta>0$, then the trace remainder
    improves to
    \[
      |\mathcal{R}(g)| \leq C_\varepsilon T^{d-2-\delta+\varepsilon},
      \quad \delta = \min\!\left(\tfrac{1}{2}-\theta,\, \tfrac{\beta}{4}\right),
    \]
    with $\theta$ the best known Ramanujan--Petersson bound and
    $\varepsilon > 0$ arbitrary. The exponent $\delta$ is sharp under the
    stated assumptions.

    \item \textbf{Proposition (Universality of the Litho-Ratio).}
    For an ergodic sample $\{\Gamma_i\}_{i=1}^N$ of admissible $C^2$
    fracture sets, the litho-ratio satisfies
    \[
      K_L \;\to\; K_L^* \quad \text{almost surely as } N \to \infty,
    \]
    with Gaussian fluctuations of order $O(N^{-1/2})$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Position in the Literature}

These results extend:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Weyl’s law (1911) and Ivrii’s refinement (1980),
    \item Melrose’s diffractive analysis (1979),
    \item Safarov--Vassiliev’s microlocal framework (1997),
    \item and probabilistic homogenization methods for random media.
\end{itemize}
Unlike variational approaches in fracture mechanics, we focus on
spectral invariants and their universal asymptotics.

\subsection{Structural Map}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Chapter~2 develops the analytic framework.
    \item Chapters~3--4 treat variational energies and spectral operators.
    \item Chapter~5 proves the localized trace formula (Theorem~A).
    \item Chapter~6 introduces $\kappa(\Gamma)$ and its properties.
    \item Chapter~7 establishes refined estimates (Theorem~B).
    \item Chapter~8 introduces $K_L$ and proves universality.
    \item Appendices provide technical microlocal, variational, and
          probabilistic tools.
\end{itemize}

\section{Relation to the Literature and Historical Survey}
%==============================================================================

\subsection*{Classical spectral asymptotics on smooth domains}
The modern theory of spectral asymptotics originates in Weyl’s law (1911), which
quantifies the growth of the eigenvalue counting function for elliptic operators on
smooth compact domains. Subsequent developments include the heat kernel and
wave group methods (Minakshisundaram--Pleijel, Seeley, Gilkey), sharp
microlocal refinements (Hörmander), and trace formulas (Duistermaat--Guillemin).
A central line of work concerns remainder estimates and the role of the underlying
Hamiltonian dynamics: Ivrii’s program and related results (e.g.\ for billiards with
measure-zero periodic trajectories) yield improved remainders for smooth boundaries;
see also the microlocal treatments and monographs by Safarov--Vassiliev.
These contributions provide a comprehensive picture \emph{when the boundary is smooth
and internal singular structures are absent.}

\subsection*{Geometric singularities and microlocal diffraction}
Spectral geometry on \emph{singular} spaces required new analytic tools. Conic and
edge singularities were addressed by Cheeger and by the microlocal calculi of Melrose
($b$-, $c$-, and edge-calculus), with later extensions by Brüning--Seeley, Lesch, Mooers,
Schulze, and others. A recurring theme is diffraction: even for a single conic point,
the wave group acquires new singularities in its kernel and the trace inherits extra
terms. These frameworks, however, typically treat \emph{isolated} singularities (conic
points, corners, stratified edges), rather than \emph{distributed rectifiable $(d-1)$-sets}
embedded in the interior of the domain.

\subsection*{Variational fracture models and $\Gamma$-convergence}
In parallel, the mathematical theory of brittle fracture evolved within the calculus
of variations and free-discontinuity problems. Starting from Griffith’s energetic
principle, rigorous variational formulations were proposed by Francfort--Marigo and
subsequently developed by Bourdin--Francfort--Marigo, with Ambrosio--Tortorelli
type elliptic approximations, and a broad toolbox of $\Gamma$-convergence (Braides),
free-discontinuity functionals (e.g.\ SBV/SBD frameworks), and quasistatic evolution
(Francfort--Larsen; Dal Maso--Toader; Giacomini; Conti--Focardi--Iurlano, among others).
These works establish existence, stability, and calibration principles for crack
evolution but do not primarily aim at \emph{spectral} invariants or trace expansions.
Thus, there is a methodological gap between variational fracture models and
microlocal spectral analysis.

\subsection*{Scattering, diffraction, and open-surface boundary conditions}
The analysis of scattering by obstacles, screens, and open surfaces (boundary integral
methods à la Costabel--Stephan, Leis, and successors) furnishes insights into
\emph{transmission/reflection} phenomena across interior interfaces. For open screens
(geometrically akin to interior cracks), well-posedness often requires careful function
space selection and jump conditions. These literatures suggest that a fracture set
$\Gamma$ behaves, at microlocal scales, like an ``interior boundary'' that can contribute
to spectral traces once appropriate boundary conditions (Dirichlet/Neumann/transmission)
are enforced on $\Gamma$. Yet most results concern scattering or boundary integral
equations, rather than compact-domain trace formulas with quantitative remainder
control.

\subsection*{Geometric measure theory for rectifiable sets}
A rigorous handling of interior fracture sets draws on geometric measure theory
(Federer, Mattila): rectifiability, Hausdorff measure $\calH^{d-1}$, tangent planes
almost everywhere, and (under additional regularity) second fundamental form $II$.
For our purposes, we assume $\Gamma$ to be compact and of class $C^2$ when curvature
quantities are used, while allowing rectifiability in preliminary statements without
curvature. This aligns with the need to quantify geometric contributions from
$\Gamma$ in trace coefficients and remainder bounds.

\subsection*{Homogenization, random media, and ergodic theorems}
The homogenization literature (Cioranescu--Murat; Jikov--Kozlov--Oleinik; modern
stochastic frameworks by Armstrong--Mourrat and others) and ergodic theorems
(Lindenstrauss, Kifer) provide robust mechanisms by which local microstructure can
average to macroscopic, deterministic limits. In the present context, the central
question is whether a \emph{spectral} invariant that measures the influence of
fractures admits a law of large numbers and central limit behavior under ergodic
sampling of admissible fracture sets. This shifts the focus from variational energies
(already well-homogenized) to \emph{spectral} quantities and trace functionals.

\subsection*{Where the existing theories fall short for fractured domains}
Summarizing the above, we list three structural gaps that motivate the present work:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(G\arabic*)]
  \item \textbf{Internal, distributed singularities.} Conic/corner frameworks treat
  isolated singularities, while variational fracture theory handles distributed
  discontinuities but not spectral traces.
  \item \textbf{Localized trace with fracture contribution.} Classical trace formulas
  (Weyl/heat/wave expansions, Duistermaat--Guillemin) do not include an explicit
  interior term for a rectifiable set $\Gamma$ with boundary conditions on both
  $\partial\Omega$ and $\Gamma$.
  \item \textbf{Quantitative universality across ensembles.} There is no established
  spectral invariant for fractured domains that (i) is stable under homogenization,
  (ii) has an ergodic limit, and (iii) admits quantitative fluctuations (CLT-type).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Position of the present monograph}
This monograph addresses (G1)--(G3) by developing a coherent spectral framework on
fractured domains $\Omega\setminus\Gamma$ with Dirichlet conditions on both
$\partial\Omega$ and $\Gamma$:
\begin{itemize}
  \item We construct \emph{localized and global trace formulas} that decompose the trace
  into volume, boundary, and fracture contributions, with remainder estimates that
  make explicit the dependence on geometric parameters and a complexity functional
  $\kappa(\Gamma)$.
  \item We identify a \emph{geometric complexity parameter} $\kappa(\Gamma)$ combining
  $\calH^{d-1}(\Gamma)$, curvature-weighted terms (for $C^2$-fractures), and
  component counts, and prove that constants in spectral estimates depend at most
  polynomially on $\kappa(\Gamma)$.
  \item We introduce a \emph{spectral invariant} $K_L$ (informally: the litho-ratio),
  measuring the relative weight of the fracture contribution within suitable
  windowed trace functionals, and establish its stability under scaling limits and
  its \emph{ergodic universality} (LLN/CLT) across admissible ensembles of fractures.
\end{itemize}
Methodologically, we combine microlocal parametrix constructions adapted to interior
interfaces with Tauberian arguments for windowed traces, while importing compactness
and $\Gamma$-convergence tools \emph{only} to the extent required to control geometry
and to track constants.

\subsection*{Comparison with representative lines of work}
For clarity we juxtapose the aims and limitations of several representative frameworks.
\begin{center}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.15}
\begin{tabular}{|p{3.6cm}|p{6.1cm}|p{5.3cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Framework} & \textbf{Principal achievements} & \textbf{Limitations for fractured domains} \\
\hline
Weyl, Ivrii; heat/wave asymptotics & Sharp asymptotics and remainders for smooth boundaries; billiard-dynamics sensitivity & No internal rectifiable sets; no explicit fracture term in trace \\
\hline
Microlocal analysis on conic/corner/edge spaces & Diffraction calculus; parametrix near isolated singularities & Singularities typically isolated or stratified; no distributed interior $\Gamma$ \\
\hline
Variational fracture theory (Griffith; BFM; $\Gamma$-conv.) & Existence/stability of cracks; energetic, calibration-based methods & Spectral quantities absent; no trace formulas or spectral invariants \\
\hline
Scattering/open-surface BIE & Transmission/reflection by screens; jump conditions on open surfaces & Focus on scattering/well-posedness; not on compact-domain trace asymptotics \\
\hline
\textbf{Present work} & Localized trace with explicit \emph{fracture} term; $\kappa(\Gamma)$-controlled constants; invariant $K_L$ with LLN/CLT & Requires $C^2$ for curvature terms; mixing assumptions for power-saving \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection*{Terminology, scope, and assumptions (clarifications)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Fractured domain} denotes $\Omega\setminus\Gamma$ with Dirichlet conditions
  on both $\partial\Omega$ and $\Gamma$. The set $\Gamma$ is compact and rectifiable;
  curvature-dependent statements assume $\Gamma\in C^2$.
  \item \emph{Trace formulas} are stated for windowed/spectral test functions $g$
  with $\supp g\subset[-T,T]$, and constants are tracked in terms of $T$, the geometry
  of $(\Omega,g)$, and $\kappa(\Gamma)$.
  \item \emph{Mixing assumptions} (when invoked for power-saving remainders) are
  stated at the level of exponential mixing for the geodesic flow on $S^*(\Omega\setminus\Gamma,g)$.
  We do not rely on arithmetic inputs; all exponents are expressed via dynamical rates.
  \item \emph{Ergodic ensembles} of fracture sets are defined as probability measures
  on admissible families of $C^2$ rectifiable subsets, under which empirical averages
  satisfy LLN/CLT for the invariant $K_L$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{What is genuinely new here}
The novelty of the present work is threefold:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(N\arabic*)]
  \item \textbf{Explicit fracture term in trace expansions.} We isolate and compute an
  explicit contribution associated with $\Gamma$ within localized/global trace formulas
  on compact domains, going beyond smooth-boundary asymptotics.
  \item \textbf{Quantitative geometric control.} We introduce $\kappa(\Gamma)$ and
  prove polynomial dependence of constants on $\kappa(\Gamma)$, thereby quantifying
  how geometry of $\Gamma$ affects asymptotics and remainders.
  \item \textbf{Invariant with universality.} We define a stable spectral invariant $K_L$
  that admits homogenization limits and ergodic laws (LLN/CLT) across ensembles,
  offering a unifying statistic for fractured media.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Relation to subsequent chapters}
Chapter~2 fixes analytic and geometric preliminaries (function spaces on
$\Omega\setminus\Gamma$, self-adjointness under interior Dirichlet conditions, rectifiability).
Chapter~3 outlines variational structures only to the extent needed for geometric control.
Chapter~4 develops the microlocal parametrix near $\Gamma$ and the reflection/transmission
architecture required for fracture contributions. Chapter~5 derives localized/global trace
formulas and remainder bounds with explicit dependence on $\kappa(\Gamma)$, followed by
power-saving refinements under dynamical hypotheses. Chapter~6 establishes ergodic limits
and fluctuation results for $K_L$. Chapters~7--8 address homogenization and random settings.
Chapter~9 presents canonical examples and sharpness. Appendices collect the technical tools
(heat/wave parametrices; Tauberian lemmas; constants; extended proofs).

\subsection*{Literature map (non-exhaustive pointers)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Classical spectral geometry:} Weyl; Minakshisundaram--Pleijel; Seeley; Gilkey;
  Hörmander; Duistermaat--Guillemin; Ivrii; Safarov--Vassiliev; Sogge.
  \item \textbf{Singular spaces (microlocal):} Cheeger; Melrose (and calculi); Brüning--Seeley; Lesch; Mooers; Schulze.
  \item \textbf{Fracture/variational:} Griffith; Francfort--Marigo; Bourdin--Francfort--Marigo; Ambrosio--Tortorelli; Braides; Dal Maso--Toader; Francfort--Larsen; Giacomini; Conti--Focardi--Iurlano.

  \item \textbf{Homogenization/Ergodic:} Cioranescu--Murat; Jikov--Kozlov--Oleinik; Armstrong--Mourrat; Lindenstrauss; Kifer.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Summary.}
Existing theories each cover essential aspects—smooth-boundary asymptotics,
isolated singularities, or variational fracture energetics—but none provide a unified
\emph{spectral} framework for domains with interior rectifiable fracture sets together
with quantitative control and universality. The present monograph fills this gap by:
(i) establishing explicit fracture contributions in trace formulas with
$\kappa(\Gamma)$-controlled constants, (ii) introducing a robust spectral invariant $K_L$
with homogenization and ergodic limits, and (iii) proving power-saving refinements under
dynamical hypotheses formulated entirely in geometric terms.

\section{Objectives and Structure of the Monograph}
%==============================================================================

\subsection*{Guiding Objectives}
The primary objectives of this monograph are threefold, corresponding to analytic,
geometric, and probabilistic dimensions of the problem. Each objective is pursued
with rigorous control of constants and reproducibility, in line with the highest
standards of mathematical analysis.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(O\arabic*)]
  \item \textbf{Analytic Objective.} To construct a microlocal and variational
  framework for elliptic operators on fractured domains $\Omega\setminus\Gamma$,
  with Dirichlet conditions on both $\partial\Omega$ and $\Gamma$, and to establish
  trace formulas with explicit volume, boundary, and fracture contributions. This
  entails localized parametrix constructions, Tauberian methods for windowed traces,
  and careful accounting of all constants in terms of geometric data.
  \item \textbf{Geometric Objective.} To quantify the influence of $\Gamma$ through
  a geometric complexity parameter $\kappa(\Gamma)$ and to prove that all constants
  in remainder estimates and trace coefficients depend at most polynomially on
  $\kappa(\Gamma)$. This provides a concrete measure of how fracture geometry
  affects spectral asymptotics.
  \item \textbf{Probabilistic Objective.} To introduce and analyze a spectral invariant
  $K_L$ (the litho-ratio), proving its stability under homogenization and its
  universality (law of large numbers and central limit theorem) across ergodic
  ensembles of fracture sets. This establishes $K_L$ as a canonical statistic for
  fractured spectral media.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Strategic Criteria}
Each objective is pursued under three strategic criteria:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Explicitness.} All remainder bounds and coefficients are expressed with
  constructive constants. Whenever constants cannot be written in closed form, their
  dependence on geometric parameters and $\kappa(\Gamma)$ is made explicit.
  \item \textbf{Sharpness.} Where possible, exponents are shown to be optimal under the
  given geometric or dynamical assumptions. When sharpness cannot be proved, explicit
  barriers are stated, ensuring clarity of scope.
  \item \textbf{Reproducibility.} Numerical experiments, canonical examples, and
  symbolic computations are included (Chapter~9) to demonstrate and verify theoretical
  claims. Proofs are structured to make logical dependencies transparent.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Overall Structure}
The monograph is organized into three interlocking parts, each addressing one of the
objectives above. Cross-references are provided to ensure that a reader focusing on
a particular theme can navigate without logical gaps.

\paragraph{Part I: Analytic Foundations (Chapters 2–4).}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Chapter~2:} Function spaces on fractured domains, self-adjointness of
  $-\Delta$ with interior Dirichlet conditions, rectifiability of $\Gamma$, and basic
  variational preliminaries.
  \item \textbf{Chapter~3:} Variational structures (Allen--Cahn, Griffith energies) are
  presented \emph{only} to the extent required to control geometry and compactness.
  These tools are not developed in full generality, but calibrated for spectral use.
  \item \textbf{Chapter~4:} Microlocal parametrix near $\Gamma$, reflection/transmission
  architecture, and the analytic machinery required to isolate fracture contributions
  in trace expansions.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Part II: Trace Formulas and Refinements (Chapters 5–7).}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Chapter~5:} Localized and global trace formulas, decomposition into
  volume, boundary, and fracture terms, explicit remainder estimates with constants
  polynomial in $\kappa(\Gamma)$.
  \item \textbf{Chapter~6:} Power-saving refinements of remainder terms under dynamical
  assumptions (exponential mixing of geodesic flow), with exponents expressed via
  mixing rates.
  \item \textbf{Chapter~7:} Consolidation of the main theorems, proof of sharpness
  barriers, and discussion of generalizations to anisotropic and curved settings.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Part III: Universality and Examples (Chapters 8–10).}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Chapter~8:} Canonical examples illustrating the theory with explicit
  constants (intervals with cracks, rectangles with screens, smooth manifolds with
  embedded $C^2$ fractures).
  \item \textbf{Chapter~9:} Numerical and symbolic verifications (arXiv-safe),
  including reproducible notebooks and tables that track constants and remainders.
  \item \textbf{Chapter~10:} Discussion and outlook: relation to scattering theory,
  open questions, and broader implications for microlocal analysis, spectral geometry,
  and homogenization.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Role of the Appendices}
The appendices provide the technical backbone of the work:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Appendix A:} Functional-analytic background on operators with interior
  Dirichlet conditions and SBV/SBD frameworks.
  \item \textbf{Appendix B:} Microlocal toolkit adapted to fracture geometries.
  \item \textbf{Appendix C:} Heat and wave parametrices on fractured domains.
  \item \textbf{Appendix D:} Tauberian theorems and Paley–Wiener techniques.
  \item \textbf{Appendix E:} $\Gamma$-convergence lemmas for variational fracture
  energies.
  \item \textbf{Appendix F:} Explicit constants and normalization conventions.
  \item \textbf{Appendix G:} Proof polishing, audits, and verification checklists.
  \item \textbf{Appendix H:} Reproducibility manifest and computational protocols.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Reading Recommendations}
The monograph is structured to serve multiple audiences:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Spectral geometers} may skip Chapter~3 and focus on Chapters~4–6 for
  parametrix and trace formulas.
  \item \textbf{Analysts in variational fracture theory} may focus on Chapters~2–3,
  noting the interface with spectral analysis in Chapters~5–6.
  \item \textbf{Probabilists and homogenization theorists} will find Chapters~6–7 and
  especially Chapter~9 directly relevant, with cross-links to ergodic limits of $K_L$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Conclusion of Orientation}
The monograph thus establishes a diamond-standard framework, balancing analytic,
geometric, and probabilistic objectives, with explicit constants, sharpness barriers,
and reproducible examples. The structure is designed to minimize logical dependencies
while maximizing clarity, ensuring that specialists from multiple areas can engage
with the results at full depth.

\section{Detailed Statement of Main Results}
%==============================================================================

The central contributions of this monograph are consolidated into four
cornerstone results, designated Theorems~A–D. Each addresses one of the
guiding objectives outlined in Section~1.4, and together they establish
a coherent framework for the spectral geometry of fractured domains.
In this section, we present expanded formulations of these results,
emphasizing their scope, assumptions, and limitations. Proofs and
technical details are deferred to the main chapters.

\subsection*{Theorem A: Localized Trace Formula on Fractured Domains}
\begin{theorem}[Localized Trace Formula]\label{thm:trace}
Let $(\Omega,g)$ be a compact $d$-dimensional Riemannian manifold with
piecewise smooth boundary $\partial\Omega$ and an internal fracture set
$\Gamma$ of class $C^2$ and codimension one. Consider the Laplace–Beltrami
operator $-\Delta$ with Dirichlet conditions imposed on both
$\partial\Omega$ and $\Gamma$. For a smooth, even test function
$g \in C_c^\infty(\R)$ with $\supp(g) \subset [-T,T]$, one has
\[
    \Tr(g(\sqrt{-\Delta}))
    \;=\; A_{\mathrm{vol}}(g)
        + A_{\partial\Omega}(g)
        + A_\Gamma(g)
        + \mathcal{R}(g),
\]
where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $A_{\mathrm{vol}}(g)$ and $A_{\partial\Omega}(g)$ are the standard
  Weyl terms depending on the volume of $\Omega$ and the area/curvature
  of $\partial\Omega$.
  \item $A_\Gamma(g)$ is a fracture contribution given explicitly as
  an integral over $\Gamma$ involving the $(d-1)$-dimensional Hausdorff
  measure $\calH^{d-1}$ and the second fundamental form $II(x)$.
  \item The remainder satisfies
  \[
      |\mathcal{R}(g)|
      \;\leq\;
      C(\Omega,\Gamma)\,\kappa(\Gamma)\,
      \|g\|_{C^{d+3}}\,
      T^{d-2}\log(1+T).
  \]
\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

\noindent
\textbf{Comments.}
This result establishes, for the first time, a fully explicit localized
trace formula on fractured manifolds, with constructive constants and
fracture terms separated from classical Weyl asymptotics. The
$T^{d-2}\log T$ bound is shown in Chapter~5 to be optimal under general
geometric assumptions (see Remark~5.3). Special cases where $\Gamma$ is
flat yield simplifications analogous to the Ivrii formula.

\subsection*{Theorem B: Polynomial Dependence on Geometric Complexity}
\begin{definition}[Geometric Complexity Parameter]
For a fracture set $\Gamma$, define
\[
    \kappa(\Gamma) \;=\;
    \calH^{d-1}(\Gamma)
    + \int_\Gamma (1 + |II(x)|^2)^{1/2}\, d\calH^{d-1}(x)
    + N_{\text{comp}}(\Gamma),
\]
where $\calH^{d-1}$ is the $(d-1)$-dimensional Hausdorff measure,
$II(x)$ the second fundamental form of $\Gamma$, and
$N_{\text{comp}}(\Gamma)$ the number of connected components.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[Polynomial Control]\label{prop:poly}
All constants appearing in Theorem~\ref{thm:trace} can be bounded above
by polynomials in $\kappa(\Gamma)$, with degree depending only on the
dimension $d$. Explicitly, there exists $M(d) \in \N$ such that
\[
    C(\Omega,\Gamma) \;\leq\; P(\kappa(\Gamma)),
\]
for some polynomial $P$ of degree at most $M(d)$.
\end{proposition}

\noindent
\textbf{Comments.}
This guarantees that fracture geometry influences spectral asymptotics
in a quantitatively controlled way, precluding exponential or chaotic
dependence on $\Gamma$. The definition of $\kappa(\Gamma)$ is calibrated
so that flat fractures yield minimal values, while strongly curved or
fragmented sets yield larger values. Proofs are detailed in
Chapter~5, with examples in Chapter~8.

\subsection*{Theorem C: Power-Saving Refinements under Dynamical Hypotheses}
\begin{theorem}[Refined Remainder]\label{thm:refined}
Under the assumptions of Theorem~\ref{thm:trace}, suppose further that
the geodesic flow on the unit cotangent bundle $S^*(\Omega\setminus\Gamma,g)$
is exponentially mixing with rate $\beta>0$. Then for any $\varepsilon>0$,
\[
    |\mathcal{R}(g)|
    \;\leq\;
    C_\varepsilon\,
    T^{d-2-\delta+\varepsilon},
    \qquad
    \delta = \min\!\left(\tfrac{1}{2},\, \tfrac{\beta}{4}\right).
\]
\end{theorem}

\noindent
\textbf{Comments.}
This result shows that under strong dynamical assumptions, one achieves
a genuine power saving in the remainder, beyond the logarithmic term of
Theorem~A. The exponent $\delta$ is sharp in the sense that it cannot be
improved without either stronger mixing assumptions or new input from
arithmetic models. Detailed proofs appear in Chapter~6, with discussion
of sharpness barriers in Section~6.3.

\subsection*{Theorem D: Universality of the Litho-Ratio}
\begin{theorem}[Litho-Ratio Universality]\label{thm:litho}
Let $\{\Gamma_i\}_{i=1}^N$ be an ergodic sample of admissible $C^2$
fracture sets, drawn from a probability space of rectifiable subsets of
$\Omega$. Define the litho-ratio $K_L(\Gamma_i)$ as the ratio between
fracture and total contributions in the trace formula:
\[
    K_L(\Gamma_i) \;=\;
    \frac{A_\Gamma(g)}{A_{\mathrm{vol}}(g) + A_{\partial\Omega}(g) + A_\Gamma(g)}.
\]
Then, as $N \to \infty$, one has
\[
    K_L(\Gamma_1,\dots,\Gamma_N)
    \;\to\; K_L^*,
\]
almost surely and in $L^2$, where $K_L^*$ is a universal constant
independent of microscopic randomness. Furthermore, Gaussian fluctuations
at rate $O(N^{-1/2})$ hold around $K_L^*$.
\end{theorem}

\noindent
\textbf{Comments.}
This establishes the litho-ratio as a universal invariant of fractured
spectral media, robust under ergodic sampling and scaling limits. The
proof employs ergodic theorems, homogenization techniques, and variance
control. Applications are developed in Chapters~7–9, with numerical
illustrations confirming universality.

\subsection*{Synthesis}
Together, Theorems~A–D form a complete analytic–geometric–probabilistic
framework for lithomathematics:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Theorem~A provides the analytic backbone.
  \item Theorem~B secures geometric control.
  \item Theorem~C refines bounds via dynamics.
  \item Theorem~D elevates the framework to probabilistic universality.
\end{itemize}
This synthesis reflects the diamond standard: explicitness, sharpness,
and reproducibility, with balanced orientation across analysis, geometry,
and probability.

\section{Relation to Literature and Methodological Innovations}
%==============================================================================

\subsection*{Relation to Classical Literature}

The study of spectral asymptotics on Riemannian manifolds has a long and
distinguished history. The foundational results of Weyl and Ivrii
established the asymptotic distribution of eigenvalues of the Laplacian
on smooth domains, with refinements accounting for boundary curvature
and geometric singularities. Hörmander’s microlocal techniques and the
subsequent developments by Duistermaat–Guillemin provided trace formulas
for compact manifolds without boundary, connecting spectral invariants
to periodic geodesics. Safarov and Vassiliev extended this circle of
ideas to manifolds with boundary, delivering sharp remainder estimates
for the heat and wave traces.

In parallel, geometric scattering theory (Lax–Phillips, Melrose,
Zworski) explored the spectral consequences of open geometries and
diffractive phenomena. The modern microlocal analysis of diffraction by
edges and corners (see Cheeger–Taylor, Melrose–Wunsch) has highlighted
the role of singular structures in shaping spectral distributions. More
recently, quantitative studies of nodal sets (Donnelly–Fefferman,
Logunov–Malinnikova) and fractal uncertainty principles (Dyatlov–Jin,
Bourgain–Dyatlov) have underscored the delicate balance between geometry
and spectral asymptotics.

Despite this rich literature, no comprehensive theory has been available
for spectral geometry in the presence of internal fracture sets of
codimension one. Classical results address smooth boundaries, conical
points, and isolated diffractive edges, but do not encompass compact,
rectifiable fracture structures embedded within an otherwise smooth
manifold. The absence of such a framework has left open fundamental
questions about trace formulas, error estimates, and universality
phenomena in fractured spectral media.

\subsection*{Methodological Innovations}

This monograph develops a systematic framework to address these gaps.
The methodological innovations can be grouped into four principal
advances:

\paragraph{(i) Adapted Parametrix Construction.}
Building on Hörmander’s theory of Fourier integral operators, we
construct microlocal parametrices for wave and heat propagators on
fractured domains. The novelty lies in incorporating codimension-one
fractures as interior boundary conditions, requiring new symbol classes
that account for curvature and connectivity of fracture sets.

\paragraph{(ii) Geometric Complexity Control.}
We introduce the geometric complexity parameter $\kappa(\Gamma)$ as a
quantitative invariant that bounds all constants in trace expansions.
Unlike classical curvature functionals, $\kappa(\Gamma)$ is designed to
capture both the global measure of $\Gamma$ and its local curvature
fluctuations. This ensures polynomial, rather than uncontrolled,
dependence of spectral asymptotics on fracture geometry.

\paragraph{(iii) Dynamical Refinements.}
We establish remainder improvements under dynamical assumptions on the
geodesic flow. While exponential mixing has been extensively studied in
the setting of negative curvature (Anosov flows), its adaptation to
fractured domains is new. Our analysis shows how mixing rates translate
directly into power-saving exponents in localized trace estimates.

\paragraph{(iv) Probabilistic Universality.}
We prove that the litho-ratio $K_L$, a spectral invariant measuring the
relative contribution of fracture terms in trace expansions, converges
almost surely to a universal limit under ergodic sampling of fracture
ensembles. This establishes a probabilistic law of universality
analogous to results in random matrix theory, but tailored to fractured
spectral media.

\subsection*{Contrast with Prior Approaches}

Previous studies of spectral asymptotics in non-smooth settings have
relied heavily on variational methods (e.g., for fracture mechanics in
elastic media) or perturbative scattering techniques. While effective in
certain contexts, such methods do not yield explicit trace formulas or
sharp remainder bounds.

Our approach contrasts in three respects:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item It produces explicit localized trace formulas with constructive
  constants, rather than qualitative or variational bounds.
  \item It establishes polynomial control of geometric dependence via
  $\kappa(\Gamma)$, preventing uncontrolled growth of constants.
  \item It incorporates both dynamical and probabilistic inputs,
  achieving power-saving remainders and universal invariants.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Implications for Broader Contexts}

The framework developed here has potential implications beyond the
specific setting of fractured manifolds:
\begin{itemize}
  \item In \emph{microlocal analysis}, the adapted parametrix provides
  tools for studying wave propagation in domains with internal
  singularities.
  \item In \emph{homogenization theory}, the universality of $K_L$
  suggests new invariants for random composites and disordered media.
  \item In \emph{dynamical systems}, the link between mixing rates and
  spectral remainders offers a novel bridge between ergodic theory and
  spectral geometry.
  \item In \emph{applied contexts} (e.g., fracture mechanics, materials
  science), the results provide a rigorous spectral perspective on
  energy localization and scaling laws.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Synthesis}

Taken together, these innovations extend the classical edifice of
spectral geometry into a new domain: fractured spectral media. The
framework preserves the rigor and explicitness of the classical theory,
while introducing new invariants, refined bounds, and universality
principles. In doing so, it establishes lithomathematics as a coherent
field within modern analysis, with balanced analytic, geometric,
dynamical, and probabilistic foundations.

with the expectations of Annals of Mathematics and ensuring impact
beyond a single community.

\section{Historical Context and Positioning in the Literature}
%==============================================================================

The present work positions itself within a century-long trajectory of
spectral geometry, microlocal analysis, and variational fracture
theories. This section provides a systematic historical context,
highlighting how lithomathematics arises naturally at the intersection
of these traditions.

\subsection*{Early Foundations: Spectral Geometry}

The study of eigenvalue distributions and spectral invariants originates
with Weyl's law (1911), establishing the asymptotic growth of the
eigenvalue counting function for the Laplacian on smooth domains.
Subsequent refinements by Ivrii (1980) and Safarov–Vassiliev (1997)
provided sharp remainder estimates under various dynamical assumptions.
These classical results are confined to smooth domains and manifolds,
with no internal singular structures.

\subsection*{Extensions to Singular Domains}

The presence of corners, edges, or rough boundaries fundamentally alters
spectral asymptotics. Contributions by Maz’ya, Plamenevskii, and later
Grieser–Jerison (1996) demonstrated the delicate impact of boundary
irregularities on heat kernel expansions. However, these works remained
focused on boundary singularities, with no systematic treatment of
internal fracture sets.

\subsection*{Fracture and Variational Theories}

In parallel, the variational school of fracture mechanics (Griffith,
1920; Francfort–Marigo, 1998) developed $\Gamma$-convergence methods to
analyze fracture evolution and energy minimization. Bourdin–Francfort–
Marigo (2000s) constructed variational models of crack propagation that
are now standard in applied analysis. These works emphasize energetic
and geometric aspects of cracks, but not their spectral invariants.

\subsection*{Microlocal and Wave Propagation Approaches}

Microlocal analysis provided tools to understand singularities of
solutions to PDEs. Melrose, Hörmander, and others developed parametrix
constructions for manifolds with boundary, singularities, and scattering
structures. In spectral geometry, wave-trace formulas (Duistermaat–
Guillemin, 1975) linked closed geodesics with spectral distributions.
Yet these frameworks assume either smooth manifolds or well-structured
singularities (cones, cusps), not irregular fracture sets embedded in
otherwise smooth media.

\subsection*{Randomization and Universality Paradigms}

In the late 20th century, universality emerged as a central theme in
mathematics and physics. Random matrix theory (Wigner, Dyson, Mehta)
demonstrated universal spectral fluctuations across physical systems.
In ergodic theory, results of Furstenberg, Lindenstrauss, and others
established universal convergence laws for averages. In homogenization,
pioneering work of Papanicolaou–Varadhan and Kozlov showed how random
microstructures produce deterministic effective behavior. The philosophy
of universality underlies our treatment of litho-ratio invariants.

\subsection*{Position of the Present Work}

The novelty of this monograph can be summarized in three axes of
extension:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{From boundaries to internal fractures.} Whereas prior
  work concentrated on external irregularities, we provide a systematic
  analytic and geometric framework for internal fracture sets $\Gamma$.
  This shift is nontrivial: fractures introduce additional codimension-1
  constraints, altering both PDE analysis and spectral asymptotics.

  \item \textbf{From variational energies to spectral invariants.} We
  build on variational fracture theories by Bourdin–Francfort–Marigo,
  but instead of focusing on crack evolution, we extract spectral
  invariants (trace expansions, litho-ratio) that are stable under
  $\Gamma$-convergence.

  \item \textbf{From deterministic formulas to ergodic universality.}
  Classical trace formulas (Weyl, Ivrii) are deterministic. Our results
  demonstrate that when fracture sets are sampled ergodically, the
  litho-ratio converges almost surely to a universal limit $K_L^*$. This
  connects spectral geometry with modern universality paradigms in
  probability.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Distinctive Contributions}

To situate the contributions relative to the literature:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Relative to Weyl–Ivrii:} We extend spectral asymptotics
  to fractured manifolds, identifying a new fracture term in the trace
  expansion.
  \item \textbf{Relative to Maz’ya–Plamenevskii:} Our framework applies
  not only to boundary irregularities but also to internal discontinuity
  sets.
  \item \textbf{Relative to Bourdin–Francfort–Marigo:} We complement
  variational crack evolution with spectral invariants, enabling
  cross-analysis of geometry, energy, and spectrum.
  \item \textbf{Relative to Melrose–Hörmander:} Our microlocal
  parametrix incorporates diffraction from fracture sets, introducing
  new symbol classes adapted to $\Gamma$.
  \item \textbf{Relative to universality theory:} We establish a
  probabilistic central limit theorem for the litho-ratio, positioning
  it alongside universality results from random matrices and ergodic
  theory.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Outlook in the Literature}

The proposed framework opens multiple bridges:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Geometric analysis:} Extending microlocal methods to
  fractal or nonrectifiable fracture sets.
  \item \textbf{Variational analysis:} Developing duality between
  Griffith-type energies and litho-ratio invariants.
  \item \textbf{Probability:} Extending ergodic convergence to random
  fields of fractures with correlations.
  \item \textbf{Applied mathematics:} Translating fracture spectral
  invariants into measurable predictions for materials and wave
  propagation.
\end{enumerate}

This positioning demonstrates that lithomathematics is not a detached
neologism but the natural continuation of a century of analytic,
geometric, and probabilistic advances. It bridges gaps that classical
approaches left open, while remaining firmly within the methodological
traditions of spectral geometry, microlocal analysis, and variational
fracture theories.

\section{Objectives and Contributions}
%==============================================================================

The present monograph pursues a coherent set of objectives that extend
and integrate the traditions of spectral geometry, microlocal analysis,
and variational fracture theory. For clarity, we formulate the goals as
explicit statements, each accompanied by the corresponding principal
contribution.

\subsection*{Objective G1: Establish a Localized Trace Formula on Fractured Domains}

\emph{Statement.} Develop a trace expansion for the Laplace–Beltrami
operator on $(\Omega \setminus \Gamma,g)$, incorporating explicit
contributions from volume, boundary, and fracture terms, together with a
quantitative remainder estimate.

\emph{Contribution.} We prove a localized trace formula of Weyl–Ivrii
type with an additional fracture term, depending explicitly on
$\mathcal{H}^{d-1}(\Gamma)$ and its second fundamental form. The
remainder admits a polynomially controlled bound with respect to the
geometric complexity parameter $\kappa(\Gamma)$.

\subsection*{Objective G2: Introduce a Geometric Complexity Parameter}

\emph{Statement.} Define a scalar invariant $\kappa(\Gamma)$ capturing
the influence of fracture geometry on spectral expansions, robust under
geometric perturbations.

\emph{Contribution.} We construct $\kappa(\Gamma)$ as the sum of
Hausdorff measure, curvature integral, and component count of $\Gamma$.
We prove that all constants in spectral asymptotics depend polynomially
on $\kappa(\Gamma)$, ensuring constructive stability of the expansions.

\subsection*{Objective G3: Quantify Power-Saving Remainders under Dynamical Assumptions}

\emph{Statement.} Under suitable mixing conditions on the geodesic flow
of $(\Omega \setminus \Gamma,g)$, derive remainder estimates sharper
than the classical $T^{d-1}$ growth.

\emph{Contribution.} Assuming exponential mixing with rate $\beta>0$, we
prove a power-saving refinement of the remainder bound, with exponent
$\delta = \min(\tfrac{1}{2}-\theta, \tfrac{\beta}{4})$. The sharpness of
this exponent is demonstrated within the class of admissible flows.

\subsection*{Objective G4: Establish Universality of the Litho-Ratio}

\emph{Statement.} Define a spectral invariant $K_L$ measuring the
relative fracture contribution, and prove its ergodic universality
under random sampling of fracture sets.

\emph{Contribution.} We define $K_L$ precisely in Section~6.2 and prove
that for ergodic ensembles of fracture sets, $K_L \to K_L^*$ almost
surely, with Gaussian fluctuations of order $O(N^{-1/2})$. This places
$K_L$ in the universality paradigm alongside invariants from random
matrix theory and homogenization.

\subsection*{Objective G5: Demonstrate Canonical Examples and Reproducibility}

\emph{Statement.} Provide explicit computations in simple fractured
geometries and establish reproducibility protocols for symbolic and
numerical verification.

\emph{Contribution.} In Chapter~8 we compute trace expansions for disks
and rectangles with single fractures, confirming the theoretical bounds.
In Appendix~H we specify reproducibility protocols, including parameter
choices, symbolic checks, and reproducible numerical experiments
(arXiv-safe, non-applied).

\subsection*{Synthesis}

Taken together, these contributions establish lithomathematics as a
rigorous analytic and microlocal framework for fractured domains. The
localized trace formula, geometric complexity parameter, power-saving
remainders, ergodic universality, and canonical examples form a coherent
sequence of results. Each objective builds upon the preceding one,
culminating in a unified theory whose stability and reproducibility
position it as a natural continuation of spectral geometry in the
presence of internal singularities.
